 * catalog.mjs — render the SCH-50 option catalog to PNG.
 *
 * Every option is rendered TWICE: an isolated swatch at 4x for comparing
 * construction, and composited into a real module page at 1x for judging it
 * where it will actually live. The in-context render is not optional. An arc
 * that reads cleanly on a blank field can collide with the modulation dot or
 * the label strip once it is in a 32px cell next to seven neighbours, and
 * reviewing widgets in isolation is precisely what has let real defects
 * through before.
 *
 * Output goes to catalog-out/, which is gitignored. Only the contact sheets
 * are committed, as the record of what was in the catalog.
 *
 *   node tools/param-pages/catalog.mjs --list
 *   node tools/param-pages/catalog.mjs --set arc-knob
 *   node tools/param-pages/catalog.mjs --all
 *
 * Node-only. Nothing here ships to the device.

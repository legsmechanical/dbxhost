/*
 * dump_contracts_device.js — device half of the fleet capture.
 *
 * ⚠ UNVERIFIED ON HARDWARE. Written without a Move available; the capture logic
 * it drives (dump_contracts.mjs) is covered by a round-trip test against a
 * simulated device, but this wiring is not. Read it before running it.
 *
 * Runs in the shadow_ui QuickJS context, where shadow_get_param /
 * shadow_set_param and the os module are globals.
 *
 * What it does, and why that is intrusive: `ui_hierarchy` and `chain_params`
 * are served by the *loaded DSP*, not by files on disk, so every module has to
 * be instantiated in a real chain slot to be captured. This loads each one into
 * PROBE_SLOT in turn. It saves that slot's current module first and restores it
 * at the end, but a crash mid-run leaves the wrong module loaded there — use an
 * empty slot, and expect audio from the slot while it runs.
 *
 * Usage (over SSH, with Schwung running):
 *   1. copy this file to /data/UserData/schwung/
 *   2. from the shadow UI's script hook, or any context that can evaluate it:
 *        globalThis.dumpModuleContracts()
 *   3. it writes /data/UserData/schwung/module-contracts.json
 *   4. copy that off the device and diff it against the fixture:
 *        node tools/param-pages/regenerate.mjs /path/to/module-contracts.json
 *
 * NEVER write the output to /tmp — the Move root filesystem is tiny and full.

 * Load a module and CONFIRM it, rather than believing the write's return value.

 * shadow_set_param returns false when the parameter channel refused or timed
 * out, which is not the same as the module failing to load -- the same
 * three-answer distinction that bit the READ path. The first real run recorded
 * 50 of 96 modules as "load failed", and the failures were exactly the heavy
 * ones (surge, osirus, minijv, cloudseed): they load slowly enough that the
 * write did not come back inside the channel's timeout. Believing that produced
 * a capture that was silently missing more than half the fleet, and missing it
 * in a biased way -- the complicated modules, i.e. the ones a contract fixture
 * is for.
 *
 * So: confirm from the device instead of from the return value.
 *
 * WHAT to confirm against took a second run to get right. Reading
 * `<comp>:module` back is the obvious choice and it is WRONG -- nothing serves
 * a GET for it (the shadow UI knows the loaded module from its own chain
 * config, not from a param), so the read errors every time. That run burned
 * both attempts on all 96 modules -- observed as each one loading exactly twice,
 * LOAD_CONFIRM_MS apart, and `param_giveup ... last_key=synth:module` in the
 * log -- and would have finished with the whole fleet marked load-failed. A
 * confirm against a key that cannot be read is worse than no confirm: it turns
 * every success into a slow failure.
 *
 * The signal that does exist is the contract itself. `chain_params` is served
 * by the LOADED module, so waiting for it to CHANGE says a different module is
 * now answering. It is also the thing being captured, so the wait costs nothing
 * extra -- the value that ends the wait is the value that gets recorded.
 *
 * Returns the confirmed chain_params string, or null if it never changed.

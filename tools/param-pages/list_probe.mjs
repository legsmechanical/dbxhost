/*
 * Records WHAT a list draw said, not where it put it.
 *
 * The one-list work deliberately changes every list's chrome, so a probe that
 * captured x/y would pin the thing being changed. What must survive is the
 * behaviour: which items are visible, in what order, which is selected, what
 * values they carry, whether edit mode was signalled.
 *
 * Selection detection is deliberately redundant, for the same reason.
 * `drawMenuList` marks the selected row with BOTH inverted text (color === 0)
 * AND a fill_rect spanning the row -- two independent chrome signals for one
 * behaviour fact, so a row counts as selected if EITHER is present. That
 * specifically survives a re-skin dropping ONE of those two mechanisms (e.g.
 * a highlight rect with no color inversion, or vice versa). It does NOT make
 * every chrome decision invisible to this probe -- assertion 7 pins the
 * `[value]` bracket convention for edit mode literally, because that
 * convention (not merely "edit mode is signalled somehow") is what the task
 * asked this file to protect.
 *
 * Two more limitations worth naming rather than discovering by surprise:
 *
 * - The label marker prefix ("> " selected / "  " unselected today) is
 *   stripped by treating any leading run of non-alphanumeric characters as
 *   chrome, not by matching today's literal characters -- so a re-skin that
 *   swaps the marker glyph (e.g. "> " -> "» ") does not require a probe
 *   change. A label that legitimately starts with punctuation would be
 *   mis-stripped; none of the fixtures here do.
 *
 * - `selectedIndex` and the entries in `labels`/`values` are ROW indices,
 *   not ITEM indices, whenever `getSubLabel` or a `type: 'divider'` entry is
 *   in play -- both draw an extra print() at a distinct y, which this probe
 *   has no way to distinguish from a second list row. Both are live in real
 *   menus (the file browser uses sub-labels; several Tools screens use
 *   dividers), so a caller of this probe against such a list must not assume
 *   `labels[i]` lines up with `items[i]`. None of the fixtures in
 *   test_list_behavior.sh use either, so this file's own assertions are not
 *   affected -- this is a note for whoever reuses the probe next.
 *
 * `announce: false` is passed by every fixture as a deliberate choice, not
 * because the real code would crash without it: `announceMenuItem` /
 * `announce()` guard on `typeof shadow_get_display_mode` and similar host
 * globals and no-op harmlessly under plain node. It is disabled anyway so a
 * probe run never depends on (or masks a change to) screen-reader behaviour,
 * which is a separate contract from what is drawn.

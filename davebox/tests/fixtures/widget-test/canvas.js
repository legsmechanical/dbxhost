/*
 * widget-test/canvas.js — the reference custom widget.
 *
 * ONE FILE, TWO SCALES. `drawCell` paints a single knob box inside the grid;
 * `draw` paints the fullscreen view you dive into from the `detail` cell. Both
 * hang off the same overlay object, so an author writes one thing.
 *
 * This module is source-only (like tools/{ui,seq,config,splash}-test) and is
 * not in the release tarball. It exists so the custom-widget contract has a
 * worked example that is exercised by tests/host/test_widget_module_poc.sh
 * rather than only described in prose -- writing it is what found that widgets
 * were being registered from the canvas-open path, which meant they never
 * appeared until the fullscreen view had been opened once.
 *
 * THE RULES A WIDGET AUTHOR MUST HOLD ON TO
 *
 *   The frame is not the screen. (0,0) is this knob box's top-left and
 *   ctx.width/ctx.height are the box's. There is no way to name an absolute
 *   coordinate, and anything outside the frame is clipped. Size everything
 *   against ctx.width/ctx.height: the same widget is handed at least sixteen
 *   different frame sizes across the two renderers.
 *
 *   You are given values; you cannot read them. There is no ctx.getParam on the
 *   draw path. A read is ~2.8ms against a 1.68ms whole-page render, so one read
 *   costs more than redrawing the entire screen.
 *
 *   The label is not yours. Schwung draws every cell's label.
 *
 *   One strike. If drawCell throws, this widget is disabled for the session and
 *   the built-in widget draws instead -- the page stays correct.

     * A SECOND WIDGET, because one module may declare several.

     * This used to be impossible, and impossible in the quiet way: the host
     * read a single `widgetKind` string, so a module naming two kinds got the
     * first registered and the second ignored -- and an ignored kind is not an
     * error, it just falls through to a built-in dial. A correct-looking page
     * and nothing to search for.
     *
     * The object form gives each kind its own drawer, which is what you want
     * when the two widgets have nothing to do with each other. (An ARRAY of
     * names is the other form: several kinds sharing one drawCell, told apart
     * by group.keys -- right when they really are one drawing at two crops.)

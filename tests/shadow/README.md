# Shadow Instrument Tests

These tests verify critical ordering and logic in the shadow instrument shim.

## Tests

### test_shadow_display_order.sh
Verifies that `shadow_swap_display()` runs BEFORE `real_ioctl()`. The shadow display must be written to the mailbox before the hardware transaction sends it to the screen.

### test_shadow_ui_order.sh
Verifies that the POST-IOCTL MIDI filtering section runs AFTER `real_ioctl()`. MIDI input arrives during the ioctl, so we must filter it after the transaction completes.

### test_shadow_hotkey_debounce.sh
Verifies that `shadowModeDebounce` resets when ANY part of the hotkey combo is released (not just when all are released). This prevents the toggle from firing multiple times.

### test_shadow_filter_hotkey_cc.sh
Verifies that shift CC (0x31) is NOT filtered in the post-ioctl MIDI filter. This allows the hotkey combo (Shift+Vol+Knob1) to work for exiting shadow mode.

## Running Tests

```bash
./tests/shadow/test_shadow_display_order.sh
./tests/shadow/test_shadow_filter_hotkey_cc.sh
./tests/shadow/test_shadow_hotkey_debounce.sh
./tests/shadow/test_shadow_ui_order.sh
```

Or run all, against the known-failing list (this is what the commit hook and CI do):
```bash
bash tests/run-ungated.sh
```

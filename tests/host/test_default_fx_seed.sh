# default_fx: a module says what belongs in the chain behind it.
# Ported from upstream #460 (+#463's factory preset), 2026-09-07.
#
# A drum module voiced through a bus compressor has had two bad options -- keep
# the effect INSIDE the module (a second, worse copy of what the slot chain
# provides, reachable only from in there and persisted by hand), or make the
# user add it after every load, where it is not part of the sound.
#
# The whole design is in WHEN it fires:
#
#  - on an INTERACTIVE PICK only. Every restore path -- boot, set change, patch
#    load -- reconstructs a chain the user has already shaped, so seeding there
#    would put back an effect they deleted, every boot, with no way to refuse it.
#  - into an EMPTY FX section only. A slot carrying effects has been shaped by
#    somebody, and appending rewrites their signal path silently.
#  - never on a FAILED read of the count. Seeding because a read did not
#    complete is how a chain gets a module appended to it for no reason.
#
# ⚠ THE FORK-SPECIFIC PART. Upstream bounds the declaration with CHAIN_CAP.fx
# (MAX_FX = 2). This fork has no MAX_FX at all and carries FOUR audio-FX blocks
# (the fork-only fx3/fx4 divergence, see CLAUDE.md). So the cap here is DERIVED
# from CHAIN_COMPONENTS, and this test pins that it is derived rather than
# written down: a literal 2 would silently truncate a module's declaration, and
# a literal 4 would rot the day the block count moves. CLAUDE.md's standing
# warning is exactly this -- "any change to FX-block handling must be checked at
# fx3/fx4 too - they are easy to miss".

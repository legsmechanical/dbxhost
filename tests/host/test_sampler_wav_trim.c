/* The quantized sampler's preroll trim, run against a real file.
 *
 * The take is recorded THROUGH the preroll — that is what makes it
 * sample-accurate to the downbeat — and the preroll frames are then cut off
 * the front on stop. When that cut silently does nothing, what lands on the
 * card is the preroll, at exactly the right length, and the user reports it as
 * "the sampler is ignoring my preroll" rather than as a file that was never
 * rewritten. That is the shape this test exists to fail on.
 *
 * The content assertions matter more than the length one: a wrong
 * implementation that truncates without copying gets the LENGTH right and the
 * AUDIO wrong, so a test that only counted frames would have passed for the
 * whole time this was broken. */

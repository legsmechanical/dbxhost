# EVERY SHIPPED help.json MUST BE READABLE, AND THE FAILURE IS SILENT.
#
# The loader's whole test is `if (helpData.children) helpMap[id] = ...`. A file
# that parses as valid JSON but names its topics anything else -- `sections`,
# `pages`, `parameters` -- is discarded WITHOUT A WORD, and the viewer says "No
# help content available" as though the file were absent. A 2026-08 catalog
# sweep found 12 modules in exactly that state, several carrying kilobytes of
# help nobody could read.
#
# This repo had one too: widget-test, the reference module for the three
# module-supplied draw surfaces, shipped `sections` and its help had never once
# been displayed. A module author copying the reference copies the bug, which is
# how this class of thing spreads.
#
# Also measures LINE WIDTH in pixels against the device font, because a help
# line is drawn, never wrapped: past the budget, upstream drops the pixels and
# the dAVEBOx viewer cuts the line short, with no error anywhere.
#
# (Taken from upstream at 866408b73 for the dAVEBOx Module Help port, #372.)
#
# NO APOSTROPHES BELOW THIS LINE inside the node script.

# Turning a KNOB to scroll a list.
#
# The jog and a knob are not the same input. A jog detent is a deliberate click
# you feel; a knob detent is a fraction of a casual twist, dozens per flick. So
# 1:1 — right for the jog — reads as "way too fast" on a knob, reported from
# the device after the knob was first routed to the picker.
#
# What is pinned is the FEEL, expressed as numbers: a deliberate turn lands on
# the entry you want, a fast turn crosses a long list, and a short list never
# accelerates because there is nowhere to go.

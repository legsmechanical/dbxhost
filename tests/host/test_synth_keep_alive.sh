# The WIRING of the sound-generator keep-alive — the opt-out from the shim's
# silence-skip.
#
# The shim parks a slot after ~1 s of silent OUTPUT and thereafter renders one
# frame in 172, waking only on non-silent probe output, on a fade ramp, or on
# MIDI. A generator whose output is the LINE INPUT has none of those levers:
# the host never inspects the jack and the module takes no MIDI. Parked, it
# drops up to ~0.5 s off the front of every phrase and swallows anything under
# DSP_SILENCE_LEVEL — heard as a noise gate that no module setting turns off,
# which is exactly how this was reported against the Line In module.
#
# Pinned here and not in a C unit because the parts that can go wrong are the
# JOINS: a capability nobody reads, an export nobody resolves, or a check that
# sits on the wrong side of the idle gate. Same shape, and same reasoning, as
# tests/host/test_idle_midi_tick_wake.sh.

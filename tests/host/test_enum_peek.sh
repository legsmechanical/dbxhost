# THE ENUM PEEK RAISES THE OPTION LIST ON A TURN.
#
# Holding an enum knob and clicking opens the PICKER: nothing is written on the
# way in, so Back is a genuine cancel. Turning the same knob is the opposite --
# the detent has already written -- so the peek is an OVERLAY over the grid, not
# a view, and it decays on its own rather than needing a way out. That is why
# the two share enum_list.mjs (one screen) but not a view (opposite semantics).
#
# THE PART THAT SILENTLY BREAKS IS THE READ.
#
# A parameter round-trip is ~2.8ms against a 1.68ms whole-page render, so a peek
# that read to find its own index would cost more than the frame it draws on. It
# does not have to: onKnobTurn has just computed the new value in the knob
# engine, and the options come from cached chain_params metadata. This asserts
# getParam is never called on the turn path once the page is settled -- not
# visible in code review, because such a read would sit inside knobStep`s seed
# fallback and look like initialisation.
#
# NO APOSTROPHES BELOW THIS LINE inside the node script: it is a single-quoted
# bash string, and one apostrophe ends it early with an error pointing nowhere
# near the real line.

 * The pixels of this screen are pinned by test_enum_picker_chrome.sh, because

 * that the peek is REACHED at all.
 *
 * It used to be drawn inside shadow_ui_param_pages.mjs, which is one consumer
 * of page_controller and not the only one: a module supplying its own
 * ui_chain.js binds the same controller and owns its own frame. Those modules
 * called render() and stopped -- which is what the whole library suggests is
 * the entire draw -- so the controller tracked a peek on every enum detent
 * that was painted nowhere, and applyInput routed Back to dismissPeek() to
 * take down a panel that did not exist. CW-78 and 6W6 both shipped that way.
 *
 * So the draw lives in the controller as renderOverlays() and the host
 * delegates. The clear stays with the CALLER: nothing in
 * src/shared/param_pages/ may clear the screen, or render()`s rect/bands
 * contract -- a consumer hosting a page inside its own chrome -- is broken.

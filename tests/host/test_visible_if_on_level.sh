# `visible_if` in chain_params, and not on the level entry, hides NOTHING.
#
# The planner reads it off the level's own params (page_plan.mjs isHiddenParam)
# and nowhere else. Declaring it beside a param's other metadata -- where every
# other field lives -- is the natural mistake, and it fails silently: every
# gated cell is drawn, no error, nothing logged. A microQ editor shipped that
# way with eight effects' controls on screen at once.

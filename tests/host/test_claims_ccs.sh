# the host does not own.
#
# #154 withheld CC 56 / 60 / 119 from Move firmware whenever the shadow display
# was up, and #175 reverted it: Move's native Undo was gone during ordinary
# chain use. The revert named the acceptable shape, a capability opt-in. This
# pins the properties that make the opt-in honest, each of which a plausible
# simplification would lose:
#
#   1. the firmware filter is gated on the RUNTIME claim bitmap, never on the
#      display being up (the #154 regression, in one line)
#   2. the press/release pairing is latched per button, so a claim changing
#      mid-hold cannot leave Move or the module believing a button is held
#   3. a Shift-held press is never claimed -- Shift+Copy / Shift+Delete are
#      the host's snapshot and recall
#   4. the host-owned controls are refused BY THE SHIM, whatever was written
#   5. the JS derives the claim from module metadata in ONE place, re-checked
#      every tick, honours the claims_edit_ccs shorthand, and the shim drops
#      every claim itself when the display closes
#
# Style-of-house grep pins (see test_contract_capture_scope.sh): the shim is
# cross-compiled and the routing runs in the SPI callback, so the seams are
# pinned by their text rather than driven.

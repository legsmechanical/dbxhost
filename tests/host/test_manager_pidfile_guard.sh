#
#     if [ -f "$PID" ] && kill -0 "$(cat "$PID")" 2>/dev/null; then : ; fi
#
# `kill -0` asks whether SOMETHING holds that pid, not whether the MANAGER
# does. The pid file survives a reboot and Linux reissues the number, so after
# an install the stale pid 928 came back as `display-server`. The guard passed,
# the manager was never started, and port 7700 was dead with no error anywhere
# — the manager log simply stopped, which reads like a clean shutdown.
#
# It only misfires after a reboot, and only when that one number is reused, so
# it is both rare and invisible. Hence a test.
#
# The guard block is LIFTED from the real script rather than restated here, so
# this cannot pass against a script that no longer contains it.

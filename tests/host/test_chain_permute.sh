# a field left out of that list keeps the value belonging to whatever module
# USED to be at the index -- a bypass flag that follows the position instead of
# the module, or param metadata that makes one module's knob write another
# module's parameter. Nothing in C catches that, so it is caught here: every
# [MAX_AUDIO_FX] / [MAX_MIDI_FX] member of chain_instance_t must appear in the
# matching collector.

# THE CLASSIFICATION, which is the one that reached hardware.
#
# A per-position array is either a VALUE array (vacating a position zeroes its
# bytes) or an OWNED-BUFFER array -- a pointer to a block allocated once per
# position and NEVER NULL. The second kind must be ROTATED: zeroing the pointer
# leaves a null that the next module load writes its param table through, which
# is a SIGSEGV on the SCHED_FIFO SPI callback (seen loading a MIDI FX in front
# of an existing one), and the shift also leaks the allocation it overwrites.
#
# The two kinds are indistinguishable to chain_permute.h, so the classification
# is written by hand in chain_reorder.c -- and therefore must not be TRUSTED.
# The set of owned buffers is not a matter of opinion: it is exactly what
# chain_alloc_position_storage allocates. Derive it from there and compare.

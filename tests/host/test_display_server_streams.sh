# THE MIRROR STREAM SURVIVES A BAD LINK. display-server is built for the host
# with its SHM paths pointed at plain files, fed a changing screen and a
# control-surface page, and read by raw-socket clients:
#
#   1. /stream-auto?v=2 carries frames, `surface`, `e16` and the `hb`
#      heartbeat the page's watchdog keys on -- through a reader STALL, with
#      not one corrupt event. Built with a 2 KB socket buffer and an 8 KB
#      queue, so the stall really does back the queue up and exercise the
#      short-write path (loopback buffers are otherwise large enough to hide
#      it: a 20 s stall on the default build never touched the queue).
#      Before: one non-blocking write() per event -- EAGAIN dropped the
#      client, and a short write spliced half an event into the next.
#   2. A reader that stays stalled past STALL_DROP_MS IS dropped (a dead peer
#      must not hold a slot).
#   3. Bare /stream-auto (an old page) sees only default events and `hb`.
#   4. Twenty idle streams against sixteen slots: the newest is still served
#      (evict-oldest), where it used to be refused and the proxy said 502.
#
# Mutation check, done by hand: making client_flush treat EAGAIN as an error
# (the old behaviour) fails case 1.

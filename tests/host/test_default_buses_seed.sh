# default_buses: a module hands its own effects over as a BUS.
#
# dr32 is the case. Its Drum Bus is four stages in series over the whole kit,
# and shipping that as ONE insert loses the only thing anyone wants from it --
# swapping just the compressor, or putting a drive between two stages. A
# container of positions is the point.
#
# A BUS AND NOT THE SLOT CHAIN, and the difference is real: a bus catches the
# VOICES, while the slot chain catches the synth's whole output including any
# returns it sums internally. A bus also keeps the module glue out of the eight
# slot positions the user wants for their own effects.
#
# Same guards as default_fx and for the same reasons -- an interactive pick
# only, and only into a slot with NO buses, because a slot that has buses has
# been arranged by somebody and adding to it silently re-routes their voices.

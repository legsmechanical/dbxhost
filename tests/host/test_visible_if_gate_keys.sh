# A visible_if GATE THAT IS NOT A CELL still moves the page set.
#
# `visible_if` hides a level whose condition is false, and the re-plan that
# brings it back is driven by the condition's value CHANGING -- which the
# controller only notices for keys it READS. It read the page's own cells and
# nothing else, so a gate the user cannot turn was a gate that never moved:
# the page set was decided once, at entry, and frozen.
#
# That is not a corner. A module whose mode lives OUTSIDE the grid is the
# normal case for a multi-engine instrument -- a drum machine where the pad you
# hit selects the voice, and a cymbal wants different pages from a drum. Such a
# module could declare a perfectly correct visible_if and watch it do nothing,
# with no error anywhere. Reported from the device on schwung-urchin: every
# page for every voice.
#
# Pinned here:
#   1. a gate key with no cell joins the page's read rotation
#   2. when its value changes, the page set is re-planned
#   3. a gate key that IS a cell is not read twice
#   4. the cap is the declared-extras cap, not a second number
#   5. validate_contract does not call a gate "unreachable"

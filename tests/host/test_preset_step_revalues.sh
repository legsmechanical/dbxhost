# Choosing a preset changes EVERY parameter, so every cached value is stale.
#
# stepPreset wrote the index and re-read the NAME, and nothing else. Nothing
# reads on the draw path -- values arrive on touch-down, on the rotation or in
# the entry warm -- and onKnobTurn steps FROM the cached value. So the first
# knob move after choosing a preset departed from the PREVIOUS presets number
# and wrote that back over the one just loaded. Reported from hardware as
# "after changing a preset, when i turn a knob it turns from the last value,
# not the presets".
#
# It is the same defect the snapshot recall has, reached by another door.
# revalue() existed for the recall, and its own comment asserted a preset load
# did not need it "because it comes back through the browser, and the re-entry
# replans and re-warms". That is true of the User Presets VIEW, which really
# does re-enter the grid. It is false of an in-grid preset PAGE, which never
# leaves -- and an in-grid page is what a module gets by declaring list_param.
#
# NO APOSTROPHES BELOW THIS LINE inside the node script: it is a single-quoted
# bash string, and one apostrophe ends it early with an error pointing nowhere
# near the real line.

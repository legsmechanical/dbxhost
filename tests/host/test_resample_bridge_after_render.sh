# THE RESAMPLE BRIDGE IS THE LAST WRITER OF AUDIO_IN IN A FRAME.
#
# native_resample_bridge_apply() overwrites the shadow mailbox's AUDIO_IN with
# Schwung's total mix. A Line In chain slot reads that same region during the
# slot render. With the bridge BEFORE the render, Line In read Schwung's own
# mix -- its own output included -- and fed back: a closed digital loop that
# rang with Resample on Mix and a Line In slot loaded.
#
# Source-order, because shim_post_transfer does not build on the host: inside
# that function the bridge call must come AFTER the render call, and exactly
# once. `schwung_spi_lib.c` runs post_fn inside the hooked ioctl, so the end of
# the function is still before Move reads the mailbox -- also asserted.

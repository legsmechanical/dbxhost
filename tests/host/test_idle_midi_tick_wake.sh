# The WIRING of the idle-tick wake. The transitions themselves are driven by
# tests/host/test_chain_idle_tick.c against chain_idle_tick.h — this pins only
# what a unit test cannot see: that the three call sites exist, in the right
# files, and in the one order the handshake depends on.
#
# It deliberately does NOT grep for the body of the state machine. The first
# version of this file pinned nine exact source lines, which broke on any
# reformat and proved nothing about behaviour.
#
# ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody reads a pass as more than it is.
# Every check below is TEXTUAL. A mod:tick call that is present, in the right
# file, in the right order, and never actually REACHED at runtime — guarded
# behind a condition that is false, or short-circuited — passes all of them.
# Verified: mutating the tick's guard to `if (0 && ...)` SURVIVES this file.
# The state machine is covered by the unit; reachability is what the device
# pass is for, and it is the one thing neither can answer.

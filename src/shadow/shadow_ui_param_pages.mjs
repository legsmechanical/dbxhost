/*
 * Shadow UI — Param Pages (the knob-grid parameter view).
 *
 * A preview alternative to the hierarchy list editor: a module's declared
 * parameters laid out eight to a page across the physical knobs, instead of a
 * scrolling list. Off by default — Global Settings -> Display -> Param View.
 *
 * Almost nothing lives here. The page model, metadata resolution, rendering,
 * navigation, screen-reader strings, the whole interaction model and the MIDI
 * decoding are in `shared/param_pages/`, pure and tested headlessly against a
 * fake device (tools/param-pages/, tests/host/test_param_pages_*.sh). What is
 * left in this file is the part that genuinely needs the shadow UI: which slot
 * and component we are pointed at, the per-frame tick, and handing off the
 * screens the controller deliberately refuses to own.
 *
 * Two hand-offs, both deliberate:
 *   - an opaque param (filepath / canvas / wav_position / string) returns an
 *     "open" intent and the LIST editor's existing screen handles it. The grid
 *     never reimplements a file browser.
 *   - a non-grid page kind (preset browser, items list, mode select, child
 *     selector) is drawn by the screens that already exist. The grid draws
 *     grids.
 *
 * State accessors come from the shared `ctx` (populated by shadow_ui.js); see
 * shadow_ui_ctx.mjs. As with the other view modules, only touch ctx.* inside
 * function bodies, never at top level.

 *              wrong and the read is merely unserved -- an unserved key reads
 *              back as "" -- so the header quietly loses its name instead of
 *              failing.
 *   returnView where Back goes. Hardcoding VIEWS.CHAIN_EDIT here dropped a
 *              Master FX user into the slot chain editor.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `startsWith("master_fx:")` test in this file. One place
 * knows there are two chain editors (chainEditorFocus / the chain targets in
 * shadow_ui.js); a second copy of that knowledge here is exactly the drift

 *
 *   a whole page render          1.62ms   (src/shared/draw_bench.mjs)

 *   host tick rate               42.3/s
 *   grid draw rate WITH the 32ms throttle    ~18fps
 *
 * Drawing every single tick costs 42 x 1.62ms = 68ms per second, under 7% of
 * one core. The throttle was not protecting anything; it was the binding
 * constraint on the whole view. Worse than 32ms in practice: this device's
 * clock is quantised to ~11-12ms, so the comparison rounds up to a 33-44ms
 * gate, and tick phase jitter drops it to ~18fps — the screen updating 18
 * times a second while the hardware offers 42. That is the "laggy knobs"
 * report, and no amount of IPC reduction moves it.
 *
 * The original "fast turns feel worse" symptom was real, but its cause was
 * setParam being called once per raw detent — fixed by SETPARAM_THROTTLE_MS
 * in page_controller.mjs, as the note there says. This was belt-and-braces on
 * top of a fix that had already landed.
 *
 * Stays zero. The tick itself is now paced to an absolute deadline
 * (shadow_ui.c), so it arrives at a steady 60 Hz regardless of how much work
 * a tick does — which is what the irregular frame rate actually was. Gating
 * the draw on top of a steady tick would only throw frames away.
 *
 * Raise it only with a measurement, not a hypothesis. That is how it came to
 * be 32 in the first place, guarding against a draw cost (1.68ms/page) that

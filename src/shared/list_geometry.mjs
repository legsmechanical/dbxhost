/*
 * FORK NOTE (dbxhost) -- read this before the upstream preamble below.
 *
 * Imported verbatim from charlesvestal/schwung v1.0.0 (e3d5bc8c) as the leaf
 * geometry the param_pages knob grid draws its own chrome against. The
 * upstream history it recounts -- menu_layout.mjs re-skinned to the movy
 * chrome, chain_ui_views.mjs holding a stale second copy -- has NOT happened
 * in this fork: `menu_layout.mjs` and `chain_ui_views.mjs` still carry the
 * OLDER chrome (TITLE_Y 2, TITLE_RULE_Y 12, LIST_TOP_Y 15, LIST_LABEL_X 4),
 * and every existing shadow list screen keeps using it.
 *
 * So the "one definition, everything else imports it" claim is upstream's
 * goal, not this fork's current state: here the names below are defined a
 * SECOND time, and the knob grid is their only consumer. That is deliberate
 * for this pass -- adopting the grid must not re-skin every list in the
 * shadow UI as a side effect. Consequence to know: a knob page drawn as a
 * LIST (LAYOUT_LIST / Param View: List) goes through the fork's drawMenuList
 * and therefore the fork's chrome, so it sits a few pixels off the grid's own
 * header. Cosmetic, and the thing to fix when the movy re-skin is adopted.

/*
 * list_geometry.mjs — THE definition of the movy chrome geometry.
 *
 * A LEAF: it imports nothing. That is deliberate and it is the whole point.
 *
 * Why it exists
 * -------------
 * These numbers used to live in TWO places. `menu_layout.mjs` was re-skinned to
 * the movy chrome (list rect at y=10, five rows), and `chain_ui_views.mjs` kept
 * a complete second copy of the OLD chrome (TITLE_Y 2, TITLE_RULE_Y 12,
 * LIST_TOP_Y 15, LIST_LABEL_X 4). Every shadow view module —
 * shadow_ui.js, shadow_ui_slots / _settings / _master_fx / _patches / _tools /
 * _store — imported `LIST_TOP_Y` from the SECOND copy and handed it straight
 * back to `drawMenuList` as `listArea: { topY: LIST_TOP_Y }`, at ~20 call
 * sites. So the re-skin was inert on the device: an 8-row dead band between the
 * header band (ends y=6) and the first row (y=15), and floor((55-15)/9) = 4
 * rows where the design says 5. The test that proved the re-skin imported the
 * NEW value and passed its own listArea, so it measured a rect no screen
 * rendered with — green, and testing the wrong thing.
 *
 * One definition. Everything else imports it.
 *
 * Why a leaf, rather than importing from render_page_movy.mjs
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * `render_page_movy.mjs` owned HEADER_H / RULE_Y / MENU_LIST_X/Y/W. Reading two
 * integers from there drags the whole page engine — five font tables, the viz
 * renderer, param_meta — into every host module that merely draws a list. It
 * would also make a cycle hard to see coming: `menu_layout.mjs` imports
 * `truncateText` from `chain_ui_views.mjs`, which is exactly why
 * `chain_ui_views` could not simply import the geometry back from
 * `menu_layout`. A module BELOW both, with no imports at all, cannot
 * participate in a cycle by construction.
 *
 * So the primitives moved DOWN here and `render_page_movy.mjs` re-exports them
 * under their existing names — its ~15 consumers are untouched, and every one
 * of these constants is still defined exactly once in the tree.
 * tests/host/test_list_behavior.sh pins that count at 1 per name.

/* ---- Screen ------------------------------------------------------------- */

export const SCREEN_HEIGHT = 64;

/* ---- The three bands ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * HEADER_H = 7: a 5-row glyph at y=1, with ONE CLEAR ROW ABOVE AND BELOW it.
 *
 * Both rows are load-bearing and the reason is the INVERTED header. When a knob
 * is touched the band fills solid and the glyphs are knocked out of it, so a
 * glyph flush against either edge has its ink running into the boundary — the
 * highlight bleeds into the border and the text stops having a shape.
 *
 * This was briefly 6, with the glyphs at y=0 on the argument that the bezel
 * already insets the top row so a margin there buys nothing. That is true of
 * the BAND against the panel edge and false of the GLYPHS against the band:
 * inverted, the thing the top row separates is text from its own highlight,
 * not the screen from its surround. Seen on hardware, put back.
 *
 * FOOTER_H = 7 at FOOTER_Y = 57, so the hint pills end on row 63 — the last
 * scanline — for the same bezel reason. The panel is inset in plastic, so a
 * dark row at the bottom is not a margin, it is a margin ON TOP of a margin.
 * RULE_Y = 55 is unchanged, and row 56 is now the clear row between it and the
 * pills.
 *
 * THESE ARE SHARED. Changing them moves every list screen in the shadow UI —
 * slots, settings, master FX, patches, tools, store, menus — not just the knob
 * grid, which is the whole point of this module being one definition. Anything
 * changed here is verified on HARDWARE, not by the suite: this module exists
 * because a re-skin once passed its own test while the device showed an 8-row
 * dead band, so green is not evidence about those screens. The 6-row header
 * above is the second time that has been demonstrated.

 *
 * It tracks HEADER_H rather than standing alone: three clear rows between the
 * band and the first row. It briefly went to 9 while the band was 6, and came
 * back with it. test_list_behavior.sh asserts the GAP for that reason — a
 * literal here would fail a change that preserved the spacing and pass one
 * that broke it.
 *
 * The knob grid's menu pages and drawMenuList — i.e. every list in the shadow
 * UI — occupy exactly this rect, or the two look subtly unlike each other.

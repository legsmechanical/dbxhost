/*
 * Peak envelope for a WAV/AIFF file, computed a little at a time and cached.
 * Ported from schwung-movy src/model/wav-peaks.ts, with permission.
 *
 * Three constraints shape this, and they pull against each other:
 *
 *   ACCURACY — a peak envelope that samples a handful of frames per column
 *     misses transients, and a granular sample is mostly transients. So the
 *     data chunk is STREAMED and every frame in a block contributes its max.
 *
 *   MEMORY — the file is never held. Blocks are read into one reusable buffer
 *     and collapsed into the per-column running max immediately, so the cost is
 *     O(width) regardless of a sample being 2 seconds or 2 minutes.
 *
 *   TIME — the shadow UI's tick IS its MIDI sampling interval, so a multi-
 *     megabyte read inside one tick would be felt as input lag. The job is
 *     resumable: each tick does BLOCKS_PER_TICK blocks and returns.
 *
 * Huge files are bounded rather than allowed to run for hundreds of ticks: past
 * MAX_BLOCKS the reader strides over the data, which trades exactness for a
 * fixed ceiling on total work. Normal samples fall well inside the budget and
 * are read in full.
 *
 * THE I/O IS INJECTED, which is our departure from movy. `std` and `os` are
 * QuickJS MODULES, so importing them here statically would make this file — and
 * everything that pulls it in, which includes viz_draw.mjs and therefore most
 * of the renderer — unloadable under node, where the host tests run. The device
 * wires the real pair in wav_io_qjs.mjs; the tests wire a node-backed one.
 * Without an IO this reports an error rather than throwing, so a caller that
 * forgets is visible instead of silently drawing nothing.
 */

/**
 * render_page.mjs — draw one param page onto a 1-bit display.
 *
 * PURE with respect to the device: every pixel goes through the injected draw
 * context, and nothing here reads a param, owns the screen, or handles input.
 * That is what lets the native shadow UI and a tool module (a sequencer drawing
 * the same grid above its own header, capturing parameter locks) share it.
 *
 *   ctx = { fillRect(x,y,w,h,color), print(x,y,text,color), textWidth(text) }
 *
 * Text is the device's own 5x7 font via ctx.print — the library ships no font
 * of its own. Measured against the fleet, 5 characters at ~6 px fits the 32 px
 * cell, which is the same size Movy's bundled 8pt font renders at, so there is
 * nothing to gain from carrying a second font around.
 *
 * Layout (128x64, the whole screen; pass `rect` to draw into a sub-region):
 *
 *   y 0..6    header: "T1 > MODULE" left, page name right
 *   y 8       page indicator — the rule is split into one segment per page,
 *             the current one filled (borrowed from Movy, and a good trick:
 *             it costs no vertical space)
 *   y 10..35  row 0 — four 32 px cells
 *   y 37..62  row 1 — four 32 px cells
 *
 * Cell layouts are switchable because the trade-off is real and only settles by
 * looking at it — see LAYOUT_BAR / LAYOUT_DIAL below.

 *                          distinct shapes rather than eight similar bars.
 *   LAYOUT_BAR             label / horizontal bar / value. Every value visible
 *                          simultaneously, which dials cannot do — worth it on

 *                          glance.
 *
 * `revealValues` closes most of that gap without a settings trip: while a
 * modifier is held, the dial layout swaps every label for its value. Eight

     * sit flush against each other, and a 1 px gap marks where the next section
     * begins. A wide block is therefore a multi-page section, so the bar reads
     * as a map of the module rather than an undifferentiated row of ticks.
     * (Approach taken from Movy, which solved the same problem first.)
     *
     * A gap is a separator, never a spacer: 1 px or nothing. Leftover pixels go
     * into the SEGMENTS, spread so no two differ by more than one — otherwise
     * the last page ends up several times wider than the rest, which reads as a
     * bug. Not paying for a separator between pages of the same section is also
     * what makes 76 pages fit at all: minijv needs 76 + 15 rather than 76 + 75.

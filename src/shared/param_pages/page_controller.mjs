/**
 * page_controller.mjs — the interaction model for a knob page.
 *
 * This is the part that would normally live inside shadow_ui.js as a few
 * hundred lines of view state, and therefore be untestable without a Move. It
 * is here instead, pure, with every device call injected:
 *
 *   getParam(fullKey)        -> string|null
 *   setParam(fullKey, value) -> void
 *   announce(text)           -> void          (optional)
 *   isModulated(fullKey)     -> boolean       (optional)
 *   now()                    -> ms            (optional, injectable clock)
 *
 * What is left for the real binding is genuinely thin: route MIDI to the
 * handlers below, call `tick()` once a frame, and call `render()`. Everything
 * with a decision in it — knob feel, staggered reads, when to rebuild, what to
 * announce — is testable here.
 *
 * Two behaviours carry most of the risk and both are pinned by tests:
 *
 *   Staggered reads. Eight live values per page is eight IPC round trips.
 *   Movy measured bulk refresh blocking ~186 ms per cycle. This reads ONE param
 *   per tick, cycling the current page.
 *
 *   Write-back suppression. A read issued before a knob turn lands after it and
 *   would drag the value backwards. Reads are ignored for a key while it is
 *   being turned and for a short settling window afterwards.

/*
 * THE ONE LIST, as a page-chrome list.
 *
 * Every row on a menu page, an items page and the section picker is drawn here,

 * browser and the enum picker. Before this it was renderPicker, which was
 * *similar* — same rect, same five rows, same 9px stride — and similar is what
 * this project exists to end.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED, so nobody has to rediscover it from a photograph:
 *
 * 1. THE SCROLL WINDOW. renderPicker centred the cursor:
 *        first = clamp(cur - floor(rows/2), 0, total - rows)
 *    drawMenuList reserves the last row instead (`keepOffLastRow`):
 *        first = max(0, sel - (rows - 2))
 *    For a 10-entry list in a 5-row window:
 *        sel=0  picker 0..4  (sel on row 0)   list 0..4  (sel row 0)   same
 *        sel=3  picker 1..5  (sel on row 2)   list 0..4  (sel row 3)
 *        sel=5  picker 3..7  (sel on row 2)   list 2..6  (sel row 3)
 *        sel=9  picker 5..9  (sel on row 4)   list 6..9  (sel row 3)
 *    So: the cursor now settles on the FOURTH row rather than the middle one,
 *    and at the very end of a list the window shows four entries with the fifth
 *    row blank rather than five with the cursor on the bottom row. That is
 *    accepted, not incidental — it is how every other list in the shadow UI
 *    already scrolls, and one list means one scroll rule.
 *
 * 2. Rows gain a "> " cursor prefix, the selected row's fill spans the whole
 *    128px width rather than stopping at the rect, and scroll arrows appear
 *    (renderPicker drew none at all, so a long list gave no sign it continued).
 *
 * 3. Labels truncate a little sooner: drawMenuList budgets a fixed 6px per glyph
 *    and pays 2 glyphs for the cursor prefix, where renderPicker measured the
 *    proportional font with fitText. ~14 chars against ~21 on a valueless row.
 *
 * `announce: false` is not optional. This controller already announces every
 * menu / items / section move itself (announceEntry, announcePageChange, the
 * picker's own announce) with position and value; letting drawMenuList announce
 * as well would say everything twice to a screen-reader user.
 *
 * EXPORTED, and chain_editor_chrome.mjs's module picker draws through it too.
 * That file already imports MENU_LIST_X/Y/W from here, with the note "imported
 * rather than restated: the two pickers must occupy the SAME rectangle, and a
 * second copy of 'x 8, y 10, w 112' is how they would come to stop doing so".
 * The row renderer is the same argument one level up: converting the page
 * chrome and leaving the module picker on renderPicker would put two different
 * lists in one rectangle, which is the drift this whole exercise exists to end.
 * The picker draws no bracket frame, so the arrow column is more conservative
 * there than it needs to be — identical is worth more than six pixels.
 */
/*
 * `editMode` is drawMenuList's OWN affordance — the selected row's value prints
 * as `[value]` — not a new one. §3.2 of the design named it the survivor of the
 * four spellings (`< value >`, `[value]`, a bracketed LABEL, and nothing at all)

     * Read the page we are about to SHOW, before the first frame is drawn.
     *
     * THE FIRST PAGE OF A COMPONENT CANNOT BE PREFETCHED. The neighbour lane
     * warms pages ±1, and nothing is adjacent to a page set that does not exist
     * yet — so on entry the rotation filled the page one key per tick, ~9 ticks
     * (~150ms), and every cell drew a confidently WRONG picture until its value
     * landed. Reported from the device: *"all of the controls up for a frame or
     * so with the wrong value before snapping to the right one"*.
     *
     * **It snaps together rather than filling in cell by cell because of the
     * viz groups.** obxd's Main page draws a filter curve from four keys and an
     * ADSR from four more, so a graphic stays visibly wrong until its LAST
     * member arrives and then the whole thing jumps. Rendered, frame 0 has the
     * filter curve collapsed into the bottom-left corner and the envelope as a
     * spike at the left edge. That is the same rule `observeLanded` enforces one
     * layer down — a read that did not answer must not become a picture — and
     * suppressing the ANIMATION did not stop the placeholder being DRAWN.
     *
     * So this is called from the load path, not from `tick()`: the controller is
     * built during input handling and the draw happens on a later frame, so a
     * warm here lands before anything is shown, while a warm on the tick would
     * always be one frame late — and one frame late is the whole bug.
     *
     * COST: ~8 reads at ~2.8ms, so ~23ms once, on a gesture that is already a
     * module transition. That is under two frames against 150ms of wrong
     * picture. The rotation would have made these same reads anyway; this only
     * moves them ahead of the first draw.
     *
     * **It stops at the FIRST failed read, and that bound is the point.** A
     * module that is not answering yet — minijv and osirus are the two slowest
     * in the fleet — costs one timeout here instead of eight, and the ordinary
     * rotation retries for free. Without the bound, entry to a slow module
     * would stall on eight dead reads, which is a far worse failure than the
     * flash this removes.
     *
     * IT RUNS ON EVERY PAGE CHANGE TOO, and the first version of this did not
     * — "deliberately NOT applied on every page change: the lane already keeps
     * neighbours warm, so a jog finds them cached". **Measured, that is false
     * at any speed a hand actually jogs.** The lane fires on ONE stop of a
     * ~10-stop rotation, so it warms one neighbour key per ~10 ticks: eight
     * keys is ~80 ticks, plus the 12-tick hold. Dwell on a page before jogging
     * on, against a 3 x 8-knob module:
     *
     *     dwell  200ms -> 1/8 known on arrival, 153ms of fill-in
     *     dwell  500ms -> 3/8
     *     dwell 1000ms -> 6/8
     *     dwell 1500ms -> 8/8, correct on frame 1
     *
     * So the lane only wins if you sit on a page for a second and a half.
     * Reported from the device as *"i still see it ... just going from one page
     * to another slowly"* — which is exactly the 200-1000ms band.
     *
     * The old objection was that blocking here puts "a hitch on the exact
     * gesture the lane exists to smooth". The measurement answers it: the
     * alternative is not a smooth gesture, it is 153ms of WRONG PICTURE, and
     * ~22ms of nothing is better than that. The lane still earns its keep — it
     * makes this call free whenever it has kept up, which is what turns a
     * per-hop cost into an occasional one.

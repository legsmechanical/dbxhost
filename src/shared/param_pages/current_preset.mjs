/*
 * current_preset.mjs — which user preset a component is currently on, and
 * whether it has been changed since.
 *
 * PURE. No param I/O, no drawing, no globals — the caller does every read.
 *
 * A user preset is the component opaque `<prefix>:state` blob, and a blob
 * carries no name, so "you are on Fat Brass" is bookkeeping we keep rather
 * than something we can ask for. The `*` is the answer to "does the live blob
 * still hash to what we stored when it was loaded".
 *
 * The one rule worth stating: a read has THREE answers, not two.
 *
 *   text   the component answered
 *   ""     it declares no state
 *   null   the read did not complete
 *
 * `null` is not news about the module, so nothing here may turn it into a
 * verdict. An unknown hash reports NOT modified — a `*` that appears because a
 * read timed out is worse than no `*` at all, because the fix for it is to
 * press Save, which would overwrite a good preset with whatever is live.
 */

/* FNV-1a over the blob. Not cryptographic — this only has to separate two
 * states of the same module, and it must be identical across runs so the
 * value can be persisted into slot_N.json and compared after a reboot.
 * Length is mixed into the returned string (not just folded into the hash)
 * so two different-length blobs cannot collide on the digit string alone. */

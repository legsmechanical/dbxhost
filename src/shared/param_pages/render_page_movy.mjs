/**
 * render_page_movy.mjs — draw one param page in schwung-movy's own layout.
 *
 * A direct port of schwung-movy's knob-grid rendering
 * (`src/renderer/{header,knob,label}.ts`, © 2026 megadake, MIT —
 * https://github.com/DimaDake/schwung-movy), not a new design: the header,
 * the bank bar, the arc knob, the enum square, and the per-column label cell
 * are Movy's actual pixel geometry, adapted to read from this library's own
 * page/metaIndex/values/viz data instead of Movy's ParamVM. The five graphic
 * bodies (envelope/filter/lfo/eq/sample) are the SAME functions render_page.mjs
 * uses, from viz_draw.mjs — also ported from Movy — called here with the
 * exact 16px-tall row boxes Movy itself draws them into.
 *
 * This is a SEPARATE renderer from render_page.mjs's own dial/bar grid, not a
 * third `layout` value on it: the two do not share cell geometry (Movy's
 * fixed ROW0_Y/LBL0_Y/ROW1_Y/LBL1_Y rows vs. the dial/bar grid's dynamic row
 * height) and mixing them into one function would make neither read as
 * either original. Selected via `page_controller.mjs`'s `LAYOUT_MOVY`.
 *
 * Same library rules as render_page.mjs: no param I/O, no screen ownership
 * (draws through the injected ctx only), no input handling. One exception to
 * "no font of its own": the enum square's two-line abbreviation needs Movy's
 * condensed 5x3 font (font5x3.mjs, ported) to fit — the device's regular 5x7
 * font cannot show two lines in a 16px box, which is the entire reason that
 * font exists. Everywhere else (header, labels) still goes through the
 * device's own print(), same as the dial/bar grid.

 * Text is set in caps with labels abbreviated to a mnemonic. The HEADER and the
 * opaque box use the device-height Tamzen; the LABEL CELLS and the enum square
 * use font4x5.
 *
 * On hardware the 5-row font read as too small — legibility mattered more
 * than knob size. Pixel geometry alone does not settle apparent size: the
 * Move panel is small, and a row count that looks comfortable in a preview at
 * 4x is not the same thing behind this bezel. The device font is 40% taller
 * (7 rows vs 5).
 *
 * That was the state until 2026-08-20, when the hint FOOTER needed eight rows
 * and the label bands were the only non-widget source of them. Labels went back
 * to font4x5 (LBL_H 9 -> 7). It costs almost nothing horizontally, because the
 * labels are already mnemonics: at a 6px monospaced advance a 4-character label
 * is 24px in a 30px cell, against 23px in font4x5, whose M is 6 wide too. The
 * header keeps Tamzen, so the module and page name are still full height.
 *
 * The enum SQUARE stays on font4x5: two stacked 7-row lines need 15 rows and
 * the box interior is 13, so the small font is the only thing that fits there
 * — which is exactly what Movy used it for.
 *
 * The rejected option is font5x3, Movy's own condensed font: at 3px wide N/K,
 * A/M and W/U collapse into each other, and real pages drew MAIN as "MAIK"
 * and SAW as "SAU". font4x5 fixed that and is still what the enum square
 * uses; it is only the LABELS that wanted more height.

 * The label cap, in M-widths.
 *
 * It is a CAP, not a fit, and it was stricter than the space available:
 * labelWidth is min(cellW - 2, fontWidth4x5("M" * LABEL_CHARS)), so a 4-across
 * grid offered 30px of cell and the cap allowed 23. "Clear" is 24px and drew
 * as "CLEA" -- reported from the device.
 *
 * 4 is a leftover. It dates from when labels were set in the 6px-advance
 * Tamzen, where four characters genuinely was 24px and all that fit. Labels
 * moved to the PROPORTIONAL font4x5 in the change described above and the 4
 * came with them, even though M is now the widest glyph in the font rather
 * than the only width -- so measuring in Ms is pessimistic for every real
 * word. "Clear" is five characters in 24px because L and E are narrow.
 *
 * 5 gives 29px, still inside the 30px cell, so nothing can overflow: the
 * min() against cellW is what actually guarantees that, and it is unchanged.
 * 6 would be 35px, at which point the cap is inert and the cell width decides
 * everything -- which throws away the mnemonic discipline this constant exists
 * to impose.
 *
 * Exported so a test can derive the same budget rather than hard-coding a
 * pixel number that a cap change would silently invalidate.

/*
 * Vertical rhythm, cut against OUR panel: 64 rows behind a physical bezel.
 *
 * THIS REPLACES AN INHERITED GEOMETRY. The bands were once a set of 1-3px
 * gutters carried over wholesale from an earlier layout, on the assumption
 * that spacing which reads well anywhere reads well here. It does not follow:
 * the spacing that reads well is the spacing that fits the panel you own, and
 * those numbers left SEVEN rows carrying no ink at all — 0, 6, 9, 24, 32, 55
 * and 56. Five of them were pure slack, and slack nobody can account for is
 * the one kind of layout decision that cannot be defended on its own terms.
 * So the rhythm below is re-derived from the two constraints we actually have.
 *
 * CONSTRAINT ONE: the widget and label heights are fixed by their contents,
 * not by taste. BOX_H is 15 because a viz body occupies rect.y+1..+14 and
 * anything under 15 stands the graphics down (the minimum-cell rule in
 * render_page.mjs); LBL_H is 7 because font4x5 is 5 rows and an inverted band
 * needs one clear row on each side. Both are ODD so an odd content height
 * centres exactly. Neither moves here — this re-cut moves BANDS, it does not
 * resize them.
 *
 * CONSTRAINT TWO: there is no need for an on-screen margin. The OLED sits
 * behind a bezel, so the top and bottom rows are already visually inset and a
 * pixel row of air spent against either edge buys nothing you can see. That is
 * what pays for the re-cut: the header's glyphs move to y=0 (band 7 -> 6) and
 * the hint pills go flush to row 63 (FOOTER_H 8 -> 7). Two rows, plus the
 * three already loose, is what makes the gutters equal.
 *
 *      0..5    header      (6)   font4x5 at y=0, one clear row under it
 *      6       bank bar    (1)   the CURRENT page's segment is 2 rows, so it
 *                                borrows the first row of the gutter below
 *      7..8    gutter      (2)
 *      9..23   knob row 0  (15)  BOX_H
 *     24..30   label row 0 (7)   LBL_H, glyphs on 25..29
 *     31..32   gutter      (2)   was 1 — the two rows now match
 *     33..47   knob row 1  (15)
 *     48..54   label row 1 (7)   glyphs on 49..53
 *     55       rule        (1)   one clear row above it (54) and below it (56)
 *     57..63   FOOTER      (7)   pill flush to the bottom edge, glyphs 58..62
 *
 * Every one of the 64 rows now belongs to a band, and the only rows without
 * ink on a plain page are the ones a band deliberately keeps clear: the gutters
 * and the single air rows either side of the rule. The two widget/label pairs
 * get IDENTICAL treatment — 2 rows of gutter, 15 of widget, 7 of label — which
 * the recovered geometry never did (2 above the first row, 1 above the second).
 *
 * The knob itself is only ~12 rows tall now that the arc is open at the bottom,
 * so a knob row carries more air below it than a graphic row does; the 15 is
 * held for the graphics.
 */
/*
 * The canvas, the header BAND, the footer rule and the list rect are DEFINED in
 * ../list_geometry.mjs and re-exported here under their existing names, so the
 * ~15 modules that import them from this file are untouched. They moved down
 * because chain_ui_views.mjs and menu_layout.mjs need the same numbers and
 * cannot reach this file without dragging the whole page engine (five font
 * tables, viz_draw, param_meta) into every host module that draws a list —
 * and because menu_layout imports truncateText FROM chain_ui_views, so any
 * arrangement where the geometry lives above them risks a cycle. A leaf below
 * all three cannot.
 *
 * BAR_Y stays here: it is the knob grid's bank bar, not chrome any list shares.

 *
 * The vertical rhythm was re-cut against the panel — header band 7 rows to 6
 * with the glyphs moving to y=0, footer to the bottom edge, and the two
 * widget/label pairs given equal gutters. That work was done while these
 * constants were the knob grid's alone.
 *
 * They are not any more. Every list screen in the shadow UI reads them, so the
 * re-cut now moves slots, settings, master FX, patches, tools, store and the
 * menus as well as the grid. That is deliberate — one definition is the point
 * of the leaf module, and a grid-private copy would re-introduce exactly the
 * two-definitions bug it was written to remove — but it means the re-cut is
 * only verified where it was rendered, which was the knob grid and the chain
 * editor. The list screens are HARDWARE-VERIFIED, not test-verified: this
 * module's own history is a re-skin that its test declared green while the

 * rows, which is exactly the pill (font4x5 plus one row of ground above and
 * below), so the pill lands on 57..63 and the footer reaches the bottom edge
 * of the panel.
 *
 * FOOTER_H used to be 8 and the pill sat on 56..62, leaving row 63 dark. The
 * `pair` helper in styles/fills.mjs argued that dark row was the ground its
 * bottom corner notches read against; it is now the bezel that does that job,

 * above the text, so the letters ran straight into the top edge of the

 * each side, which is what makes an inverted run legible.
 *
 * The two rows this costs come back from the widget rows, which drop 16 -> 15:

 * of radius r, then a disk of radius r-1 in the background colour punched
 * through the middle. That is NOT a ring. At each cardinal the two disks
 * reach the same column extent (floor(sqrt(r*r-1)) === r-1 for every r we
 * draw), so the ring loses the pixel just inside the extreme one and the
 * extreme pixel is stranded over a gap: four detached dots sitting outside
 * an otherwise flat-sided outline, which is what "the circles have little
 * dots on the outside" was. No integer radius escapes it — it is a property
 * of the difference of two rasterised disks, not of this size. The headless
 * harness never showed it because its draw context supplied no fillCircle,
 * so previews and snapshots only ever exercised the JS fallback;
 * `tools/param-pages/harness.mjs` now offers the native primitives too.
 *
 * The JS fallback below is NOT a midpoint/Bresenham walk, for the same
 * reason: at r=7 that strands a lone pixel at each of the four compass
 * points, one row proud of the run behind it, which reads as a spike on the
 * outside of the circle. Both paths use the distance-rounding ring instead —
 * see js_display_draw_arc. Keep them identical: the harness renders the
 * fallback, the device renders the native one, and a preview that disagrees
 * with the OLED is how the original bug survived review.
 *
 * The track is an OPEN ARC, not a closed ring, and the pointer FLOATS clear
 * of both the centre and the rim. Both carry information a circle does not:
 *
 *   - The gap marks the ends of travel. Drawing a full 360 ring while the
 *     pointer only sweeps 300 leaves 60 degrees of track the value can never
 *     reach, and says the control wraps around when it does not. Reusing the
 *     pointer's own numbers (KNOB_START_DEG / KNOB_SWEEP_DEG) makes the two
 *     agree by construction.
 *   - A pointer welded from the exact centre to the rim reads as a clock hand
 *     or a pie slice. A short stroke floating between roughly a quarter and
 *     four-fifths of the radius reads as an indicator aimed at a scale.
 *
 * The gap is also forced, not only chosen: at KNOB_R 8 a CLOSED ring needs 17
 * rows and the widget box is 15, so the bottom of the circle has nowhere to go.
 * Opening the arc where the travel already ends spends that constraint on
 * something that means one thing.

 *   pointer  KNOB_START_DEG 225 / KNOB_SWEEP_DEG 270. Travel bottoms out on
 *            the 225 diagonal, so a pointer at either extreme sits on a clean
 *            45-degree run rather than on a rounding-dependent angle.
 *
 * The 5-degree inset between the pointer travel and the track is deliberate,

 * SCH-50 `thin-frame`. Two changes from Movy's construction, both small:
 *
 *   - The corners are NOTCHED. See `notchCorners` — the one idiom the whole
 *     catalog converged on, and the only thing on this widget that is ours.
 *   - The text box runs to the INSIDE OF THE FRAME (ENUM_TEXT_W, 18px) instead
 *     of holding a further 2px margin off it (16px). At three characters that
 *     is not cosmetic: it is the difference between "PAS" and "PA".
 *
 * Effectively a no-change vote, and taken as one deliberately. An enum square
 * is a framed box containing a word, which is about as generic as a widget
 * gets, so there is probably no house style in it worth changing. What matters
 * is the CROSS-SET constraint: `drawOpaqueBox` must stay distinguishable from
 * this, and it is — it is bracketed-and-broken where this is closed and framed.
 *
 * The accepted collision is with the FADER, which SCH-50 also made a framed
 * notched box (`outline-fill`, viz_draw.mjs). A page mixing continuous faders
 * with enums now distinguishes the two by CONTENT, not by silhouette. That was
 * declined-alternative-and-kept, not an oversight: a frameless enum square was
 * available and would have dissolved it. If it reads badly on hardware, the
 * cheap fix is this widget, not the fader.
 *
 * THE WIDTH IS THE VALUE'S, NOT THE CELL'S. `kx` still names the left edge of
 * the nominal `ENUM_W` slot the caller centred in the cell — the signature is
 * unchanged and the catalog tooling still calls it with four arguments — and
 * the narrower box is centred inside that slot, which is the same as centring
 * it in the cell.
 *
 * `anim` and `nowMs` are OPTIONAL and trailing. Without them the square is
 * drawn at its natural width and nothing moves, which is the whole point of the
 * ordering: the static sizing is the improvement and the motion is a by-product
 * of it. Every existing caller — the knob card, `composite.mjs`, `catalog.mjs`,
 * the device before a controller opts in — gets the better static box and no
 * behaviour it did not ask for. A missing `anim` is the normal case, not an

 * type in the fleet this was built against — but needed so an opaque param on a
 * Movy-style page is a door to its existing editor.
 *
 * SCH-50 `door-open`. IT NOW DRAWS ITS OWN FRAME, and that is a swap, not an
 * addition: it used to draw none at all and wear the divable brackets as its
 * frame instead. `drawKnobRow` therefore suppresses the bracket for this kind —
 * see the alsoOpens() call site — so the two never double up.
 *
 * The frame is a notched 1px box with its RIGHT EDGE CUT AWAY for five rows and
 * a 3-row chevron sitting in the gap, with the value set left of it. Three
 * things follow from that shape:
 *
 *   - It is the only cell on the page that says which DIRECTION its door goes.
 *     An opaque cell's whole job is to be a door — roughly FIVE params in the
 *     entire fleet against ~135 enums — so marking the door explicitly is worth
 *     a cell this rare spending pixels on.
 *   - The broken edge means it can never be confused with an enum square
 *     however the widths fall, which matters now that the enum square
 *     (`thin-frame`) and the fader (`outline-fill`) are BOTH closed framed
 *     boxes.
 *   - It spans the CELL, not the KW widget box, which is what buys the room for
 *     a filename beside a chevron. `cellOf` recovers the cell from `kx` rather
 *     than taking it as an argument, so the signature is unchanged.
 *
 * ACCEPTED COST, recorded because it is the pick most likely to be reversed:
 * a 1px pictogram either reads instantly or reads as debris, and that is not
 * decidable from code or from a 4x render. Watch it on hardware.
 *
 * DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM THE CATALOG OPTION: the text still comes from
 * `displayValue`, not from the option's own ad-hoc formatter. Two behaviours
 * live in `displayValue` that the catalog dropped because a swatch never
 * exercised them — it takes the BASENAME of a path ("/x/kick.wav" -> "kick.wav")
 * and it renders an empty or absent value as "--" rather than as nothing. A
 * canvas param reports "", and a door with no text in it looks broken. Porting

 * The hint footer.
 *
 * Hints come from the CALLER, never from here: which gesture does what is the
 * input mapping's business, and this library does not own input (same rule that
 * puts the first-run hint panel's text in the caller's hands). A tool embedding
 * the grid has its own gestures and must be able to say so.
 *
 * FIT-AWARE, in priority order. Measured across the real vocabulary, a pair
 * costs 24-38px, so THREE pairs only fit when every word is <= 4 characters:
 *
 *     JOG PAGE / SHFT SECT / CLK MENU     134px   does NOT fit
 *     JOG SCRUB / CLK OPEN / MUTE DFLT    139px   does NOT fit
 *     JOG SEL / CLK LOAD / BACK EXIT      126px   fits
 *     any two pairs                       84-98px always fits
 *
 * So the caller passes hints most-important-first and the tail is dropped, not
 * squeezed: a half-drawn pill running off the right edge is worse than an
 * absent one.
 *
 * BACK IS THE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS A RULE: a back hint is PINNED TO THE RIGHT
 * EDGE, and it is the last hint to be dropped, not the first.
 *
 * Being last in the array is not the same as being on the right. With two
 * pairs, packing left-to-right leaves BACK sitting mid-screen with ~30px of
 * space beside it — which is what "JOG MOVE / BACK EXIT" looked like on the
 * chain editor under Shift. "Back is bottom-right" is a fixed place the user
 * can learn, so it must not move with the number of hints beside it.
 *
 * This also removes the old advice to "put BACK first if it matters", which
 * traded the rule away to survive the tail-drop. Pinning gets both: BACK holds
 * the right edge AND is protected, so the hints that lose to a narrow screen
 * are the middle ones.

/**
 * page_nav.mjs — moving around a PageSet.
 *
 * PURE: takes a page list and an index, returns a new index. No input handling,
 * no state of its own; the caller owns the cursor. Both the native shadow UI
 * and a tool driving the same grid need identical navigation semantics, and the
 * only way to guarantee that is to put the rules in one place.
 *
 * Why this exists as more than `index + 1`:
 *
 *   - minijv plans to 69 grid pages and surge to 49. Linear jog through those
 *     is not navigation, it is a chore, so there is a level-skip step and a
 *     jump index.
 *   - 52 of the fleet's 572 grid pages are continuation pages holding one or
 *     two controls, an unavoidable consequence of a level with 9 keys and a
 *     first page that must stay exactly `knobs[0..7]` (see page_plan.mjs).
 *     They are cheap to skip rather than impossible to create.
 *   - the page set is rebuilt whenever the declared contract changes — a
 *     module finishing its load and republishing a bigger tree, a minijv mode
 *     switch. The cursor has to land somewhere sensible afterwards.

/**
 * list_knob.mjs — turning a KNOB to scroll a list.
 *
 * The jog and a knob are not the same input, and treating them the same is
 * what this fixes. A jog detent is a deliberate click you feel; a knob detent
 * is a fraction of a casual twist, and there are dozens of them in one flick
 * of the wrist. So 1:1 — correct for the jog — reads as "way too fast" on a
 * knob, reported from the device.
 *
 * Two rules, and the second is the one that makes long lists usable:
 *
 *   1. A slow, deliberate turn costs DETENTS_PER_ENTRY detents per entry, so
 *      you can land on the one you want.
 *   2. A fast turn accelerates — but only as far as the list is long. A
 *      6-option enum never accelerates at all (there is nowhere to go); a
 *      519-entry airwindows list can move 16 entries a step, which crosses it
 *      in about a hundred detents instead of fifteen hundred.
 *
 * Length-aware acceleration is the whole trick. A fixed multiplier is either
 * useless on the long lists or uncontrollable on the short ones, and the fleet
 * has both: Braids has 47 models, `clap` has 519 effects, and a Recv Ch has
 * 17.
 *
 * PURE and injected-clock, so the feel is testable without a device — see
 * tests/host/test_list_knob.sh.

 * not accelerate at all — there is nowhere to go, and a 6-option enum that
 * jumped 3 at a time would be unusable.
 *
 * Calibrated against the real fleet rather than a round number: Braids has 47
 * models (ceiling 5, so a fast spin crosses it in ~28 detents), `clap` has 519
 * effects (ceiling capped at 16, ~98 detents), a Recv Ch has 17 (ceiling 2 —
 * present but gentle, since you are usually going one or two places).

 * Per-DETENT gaps, in ms, that count as a fast turn.

 * Per detent, not per step, and that distinction was a bug worth recording. A
 * step is DETENTS_PER_ENTRY detents, so measuring the gap between STEPS and
 * calling 60 ms "fast" actually meant 20 ms per detent — an ordinary brisk
 * turn. Nearly every real spin hit the ceiling immediately, which is what
 * "the fast spins are too fast" was: not the ceiling being wrong, the gate
 * being wide open.
 *
 * 8 ms per detent is a genuine flick; 14 ms is a hard spin. Anything slower is
 * steering, and steering must not accelerate AT ALL.
 *
 * These were 12/25 and both were still too generous: at 20 ms/detent — an
 * ordinary purposeful turn — a 116-entry wavetable list took the brisk band,
 * 3 entries a step, i.e. one entry per detent. Reported as "everything still
 * feels 2x too fast (looking at the wavetable list)".

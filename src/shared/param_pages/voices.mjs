/**
 * voices.mjs — what a module says about its performance surface.
 *
 * Two questions a sequencer has to answer before it can draw anything, and
 * until now could not ask: is this a drum rack or a keyboard, and what does
 * each pad address? Movy answers both from a private table —
 * `movy_config.json`, 14 bundled configs and a 4-module override list — and
 * `padScoping.concreteKeyTemplate` in it is a verbatim re-spelling of
 * `child_key_template`. Every sequencer that ever ships would rebuild that.
 *
 * LAYOUT IS DECLARED, NEVER INFERRED. The obvious shortcut — "it has notes on
 * its pages, so it is drums" — is wrong: a sampler with key zones, a
 * multitimbral synth and a chord module all legitimately carry notes on
 * per-zone pages, and inference would seat them as racks. So `pad_layout` is its
 * own statement, and ABSENT IS A THIRD STATE meaning the module has not said.
 * All 100 captured fleet modules are in that state; answering "chromatic" for
 * them would put words in their mouth and make "declared melodic"
 * indistinguishable from "never asked".
 *
 * VOICES ARE ORDERED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. The order is a fact with several
 * consumers, and a fact with several consumers written down in none of them is
 * how the metronome and recall_quantize both got the same off-by-one. It is
 * why the chain host reports a NOTE and not a voice index: a second ordering
 * implementation in C would fail silently as "the grid follows the wrong pad".
 *
 * PURE. It never reads a param. Callers pass a hierarchy object in and get
 * plain data out.

 *
 * `Object.keys` IS THE ORDER, and it is not quite declaration order: JavaScript
 * enumerates INTEGER-LIKE keys first, ascending, before the rest in insertion
 * order. So `{root, "10": …, "2": …, "1": …}` walks 1, 2, 10 — the module's

 * numeric-looking levels must LINK them from root, where declared order is

/**
 * font5x3.mjs — schwung-movy's condensed 5x3 font, ported
 * (`src/font/{glyphs5x3,index5x3,blit}.ts`, © 2026 megadake, MIT —
 * https://github.com/DimaDake/schwung-movy).
 *
 * Movy uses this only for the enum square (a 16x16 knob box): the device's
 * regular 5x7 font cannot fit two lines in that space, so Movy rasterised a
 * second, smaller font and shows two short abbreviated words stacked
 * ("LOW"/"PAS" for "Low Pass") instead of one truncated line. Nothing else
 * in this library uses it — the header, labels and every other string still
 * go through the device's own 5x7 print(), same as render_page.mjs.
 *
 * Glyph format: [advance, yOff, w, h, ...rowBits], bit0 = leftmost pixel —
 * identical encoding to Movy's source, copied verbatim rather than
 * re-derived, so the glyph shapes are exactly what Movy ships.

   * '_' survives in file stems and raw enum options (LEAP_OUTWARD), and '\'
   * and '^' are shape GLYPHS in their own right — several modules name their
   * LFO waveforms "/\-_" and "SINE^". Dropping any of them would silently
   * render "C" for "C#" or an empty box for a waveform name. Same 3x5 cell,
   * bit0 = leftmost, so they measure and blit identically to the ported
   * glyphs. tests/host/test_param_pages_movy.sh sweeps every label, value and
   * enum option in the fleet and fails if a sixth is ever needed. */

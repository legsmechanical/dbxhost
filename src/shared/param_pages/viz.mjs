/**
 * viz.mjs — resolve a page's parameter groups to a graphic, if any.
 *
 * PURE, like the rest of the library: given a page's keys and a metaIndex, it
 * returns a list of resolved groups. It draws nothing (see viz_draw.mjs) and
 * reads no param. What varies between an author's intent and a guess is only
 * how a group was RESOLVED — that lives entirely in this file, so a renderer
 * never has to know or care which source won.
 *
 * Precedence (docs/MODULES.md "Parameter visualisations (viz)",
 * docs/plans/2026-07-26-param-pages-audit.md §13.5):
 *
 *   module chain_params `viz`  →  module layout file  →  host override  →  detector  →  none
 *
 * The module always wins over the host. A host override may correct a
 * detector but must never overrule an author who did the work.
 *
 * "module layout file" is the still-open, undesigned mechanism tracked in the
 * audit doc (§13.5 item 3) — zero fleet modules ship one today, so there is
 * nothing to read yet. The slot is left as a documented no-op rather than
 * invented here.
 *
 * Order matters for two reasons: it is the order detectors get first refusal
 * on unclaimed keys (a key already grouped by an earlier-firing detector is
 * never reconsidered by a later one), and it is the risk ordering agreed in
 * the audit — envelope first because a wrong ADSR shape is obvious on screen,
 * EQ last because its false positives are the hardest to spot.

 *   deep floor    min <= -30. A silence floor, not a cut. 4k-eq's band gains
 *                 are dB and bipolar at +-15, and they are trims around unity;
 *                 they should form an EQ, not four separate faders.
 *   asymmetric    max < -min. A level has far more attenuation than boost. A
 *                 symmetric +-48 is a trim no matter how deep it goes, which
 *                 is what keeps surge's level_pfg out.
 *
 * Measured on the 100-module fleet: 14 params are named like a fader and

     * that admits the spray, and the two are not alike. Everything else in
     * this graphic is a position WITHIN the sample and dives to the waveform
     * editor; the filepath is how you REPLACE the sample and dives to the file
     * browser. Claiming it drew one continuous waveform across a boundary
     * where the behaviour changes — reported from the device twice in a row,
     * *"sample file isn't part of the continuum because it goes to a different
     * editor"* and then *"why is there a line that spans between them?"*
     *
     * Released, the cell draws as the ordinary opaque box: notched frame,
     * chevron, and THE FILENAME — which is information the graphic was
     * throwing away. That is also the real answer to the report this whole
     * thread started from ("empty sample selection is indistinguishable from
     * the spray control"): the honest fix was never to bracket the cell, it
     * was to stop swallowing it.
     *
     * `roles.value` is untouched, so the waveform still comes from this file,
     * and the value is still read: the page cursor walks page.keys, not
     * group.keys. `extraKeys` remains for an OFF-page file, which is the case
     * it was built for.
     *
     * Unrelated to the no-anchor branch above, where a filepath with no marker

 * and `spray` opened nothing, because it is a plain float and nothing is
 * declared behind it. Asked from the device: "shouldn't the whole thing be
 * divable?" It should: the user is looking at one picture, and a click on the
 * left third of it doing something while the middle does nothing is the
 * picture disagreeing with itself.
 *
 * So a cell that is part of a sample graphic and has no door of its own dives
 * to the graphic's own anchor — the position marker, whose editor draws that
 * same waveform full-screen with the same fences.
 *
 * DERIVED, never named. The rule is "a member of the picture with nothing
 * behind it", not "spray": nothing here mentions the key, so a future member
 * seated into a sample graphic inherits this without a second edit, and a
 * member that HAS its own door (the filepath) keeps it — the `self.divable`
 * bail is what protects the file browser from being swallowed by the editor.
 *
 * Scoped to VIZ_SAMPLE alone. An envelope or a filter curve is a picture of
 * several knobs with no editor behind it, so there is nothing to dive to and
 * this would invent a destination.
 *
 * ONE definition for three consumers — the click (page_controller), the
 * footer hint (shadow_ui_param_pages) and the corner brackets
 * (render_page_movy). Three copies of "is this cell a door" is how a footer
 * comes to promise CLK OPEN over a click that does nothing, which is the
 * mismatch the hint site already carries a comment about.

 * shape spanning both would draw straight through the label band. That is a
 * real constraint, not a tunable one.

 * LAYOUT alone, and they are the flagship case — the ADSR on the Main page of
 * obxd, hush1, minijv, moog, surge, rex, osirus, helm, braids and sfz, plus
 * twelve surge LFO pages. An author writing `attack, decay, sustain, release`
 * in the obvious order lands on slots 3..6 and gets four separate dials.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is as important as what it does:
 *
 *   * it never changes WHICH keys are on the page, so no knob is pushed to
 *     another page and no orphan page is created. Max group span is 4 and a
 *     row is 4 wide, so a group always fits somewhere in the 8 — measured, 25
 *     of the 26 displace exactly ONE knob and one displaces two.
 *   * it never reorders for cosmetics. The move must strictly increase the
 *     number of keys covered by a group; a page whose groups already draw is
 *     returned untouched.
 *   * it preserves relative order. The candidate is a BLOCK MOVE, so the
 *     author's sequence survives apart from the block that moved.

/**
 * page_input.mjs — Move hardware MIDI → what the knob page should do.
 *
 * Separated from the controller and from shadow_ui.js because this is where
 * the boring bugs live: the wrong CC, a relative encoder decoded as absolute,
 * a modifier that latches. None of that needs a device to get wrong, so none of
 * it should need a device to test.
 *
 * PURE: a message plus modifier state in, an intent out. The caller applies the
 * intent to a controller. Nothing here touches hardware, params or the screen.
 *
 * The map (see CLAUDE.md, "Move Hardware MIDI"):
 *   CC 71-78     knobs 1-8, relative: 1..63 clockwise, 65..127 anticlockwise
 *   CC 14        jog wheel turn, same relative encoding
 *   CC 3         jog click
 *   CC 49        shift  (NOT forwarded in shadow mode — see the host note below)
 *   CC 51        back
 *   CC 88        mute, used here as the modifier for destructive actions
 *   notes 0-7    knob capacitive touch (velocity > 0 = touched)

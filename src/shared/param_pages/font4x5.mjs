/**
 * font4x5.mjs — a proportional 5-tall font for the Movy knob grid.
 *
 * The metrics are cut for this grid and for nothing else. A 128px header has
 * to carry a real parameter name, so: five rows tall, proportional advance
 * with the 1px inter-glyph gap folded in, a typical cap 4 wide on a 5px
 * advance. The number in brackets is the glyph WIDTH; the advance is one more.
 *
 *      A(4)   M(5)   I(1)  T(3)   U(4)      5 rows tall
 *      .##.   ##.##   #    ###    #..#      proportional width, 1px gap
 *      ####   #.#.#   #    ###    #..#      typical cap 4 wide -> 5px advance

 *
 * This sits deliberately between the two fonts this grid tried first, both of
 * which were wrong in opposite directions:
 *
 *   - The device's own 5x7 is TWO ROWS TALLER, which is what forced an 8-row
 *     label band and left no vertical gutter between a label and the knob row
 *     under it. Its 6px monospaced advance also fits only ~5 characters in a
 *     32px cell.
 *   - font5x3 (Movy's condensed font, 3 wide) fixed the height but at 3px the
 *     letterforms collapse: N and K differ only in which row their bar sits
 *     on, A and M by a single top-row pixel, and W reads as U. Real pages
 *     rendered MAIN as "MAIK", SINE as "SIKE", SAW as "SAU".
 *
 * Four pixels is enough for an unambiguous N (`#..#/##.#/#.##/#..#`) against
 * K (`#..#/#.#./##../#.#.`), and proportional advance is doing real work: `I`
 * is one pixel wide, which is most of why a word like AMPLITUDE fits a header.
 *
 * Glyph format matches font5x3.mjs exactly — [advance, yOff, w, h, ...rowBits]
 * with bit0 = leftmost pixel — so the two blit identically and a caller can
 * swap one for the other. font5x3 is still the right font for the enum SQUARE:
 * two stacked lines in a 16px box need 3-wide glyphs to fit three characters
 * per line, which 4-wide cannot.
 *
 * THE LETTERFORMS (SCH-50). The skeletons below are the `metric-matched`
 * option from the SCH-50 catalog, adopted because it is the only redraw in
 * that set that costs no layout pass: **every advance equals the advance it
 * replaced, to the pixel**, so every string in the product renders at exactly
 * the width it did before. The metrics above did not move and must not — a
 * 4-wide cap on a 5px advance is the geometry every cell in this grid was cut
 * for, and changing it moves text everywhere. What changed is what fills that
 * box.
 *
 * THE CONSTRUCTION RULE: top-loaded. The face this replaces was a neutral
 * grotesque with its waist dead centre and a matching bar at each terminal;
 * this one moves the weight up.
 *
 *   - A crossbar rides at row 1 rather than row 2 — A E F H K N Y Z and the
 *     digits 4 and 9 all carry it one row higher, giving a small tight head
 *     over a long open leg instead of two equal halves.
 *   - A stemmed letter takes a FULL-WIDTH flat head: B C D E F G J P R S all
 *     start on `####` where the old face started on `###.` or `.###`.
 *   - A foot is cut back, so the bottom row is narrower than the top: D closes
 *     to `###.`, L stops one column short, C and G tuck to `.###`.
 *   - The round letters O Q 0 are the stated exception. A flat head needs a
 *     stem to hang on; with no stem it is a rectangle, and a rectangular O one
 *     pixel from a rectangular D is not a face, it is a defect.
 *
 * Two glyphs are legibility overrides rather than rule, and both are places
 * this codebase has already been burnt:
 *
 *   - U closes FLAT (`####`) rather than cut back. The 3-wide font this file
 *     replaced rendered SAW as SAU, and a rounded candidate in the catalog had
 *     to buy its U a fifth column after AMPLITUDE came out AMPLITVDE. At
 *     advance 5 there is no fifth column to buy, so the U is settled by being
 *     square-bottomed, which no V ever is.
 *   - I is the forced exception. Its advance is 2, so its body is one pixel
 *     wide by five tall — a full stem IS the only way to draw it. It takes the
 *     cut foot the rule gives D and L, expressed the only way a 1px column
 *     can: one row short.

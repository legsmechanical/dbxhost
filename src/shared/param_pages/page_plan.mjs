 * plain objects; the caller does every read and write. This is what lets the
 * same planner serve the native shadow UI (which owns input and commits values)
 * and a tool module like a sequencer (which owns input and commits to its own
 * step data for parameter locks). See
 * docs/plans/2026-07-26-param-pages-audit.md.
 *
 * The tree walk follows the rules validated against a 76-module fleet capture:
 * visit both `params` nav edges and `children` (always, not either/or), no
 * depth cap, dedupe authored pages by exact key list, `children`-reached levels
 * are prefix-transparent, orphan sweep at the end so every declared knob is
 * reachable.

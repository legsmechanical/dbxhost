/**
 * child_key.mjs — addressing repeated elements (drum pads, tones, parts, voices)
 * from declared metadata alone.
 *
 * The problem, quantified: a drum module has 16 pads sharing ~14 params, so it
 * declares 200+ concrete keys (`p01_vol`, `p02_vol`, …). Listing them all in a
 * menu is unusable, so modules list an *alias* (`pad_vol`) meaning "the focused
 * pad" and keep the concrete keys undeclared in any level. Fleet-wide that is
 * the single largest source of unreachable params: mrdrums 209, weird-dreams
 * 187, forge 106.
 *
 * Schwung already documents `child_prefix` / `child_count` / `child_label` for
 * exactly this (docs/MODULES.md), and shadow_ui.js implements it — but it
 * assumes one fixed key shape, `${prefix}${index}_${key}`, which none of those
 * six modules use. So they each solved it again in a third-party config file.
 *
 * This is the smallest extension that lets them stop: an explicit key template,
 * an index base, zero-padding, and per-key overrides. `child_prefix` stays as
 * sugar for the shape it already means, so nothing that works today changes.
 *
 *   "pads": {
 *     "child_count": 16,
 *     "child_label": "Pad",
 *     "child_key_template": "p{index}_{key}",
 *     "child_index_base": 1,          // pads are 1..16, not 0..15
 *     "child_index_digits": 2,        // p01_, not p1_
 *     "child_key_overrides": { "fx1": "v{index}_{key}" },
 *     "knobs": ["vol", "pan", "tune"]
 *   }
 *
 * PURE. Given a level and an index it produces a key; it never reads a param.

 * deliberate navigation choice, and wrong for a drum module, where hitting a
 * pad is how you choose the thing you are editing. mrdrums is the case --

 * the UI the grid would sit on Pad 1 while the module moved on, and declaring
 * a child level at all would COST that behaviour. This is what makes the
 * declaration additive for such a module instead of a trade.
 *
 * The param is the single source of truth in BOTH directions: a pick writes
 * it, and reading it back is what moves the UI. So there is no third copy of
 * the index to disagree, and a module that moves the focus itself and a user
 * who picks from the list cannot fight -- they are the same write.
 *
 * OPTIONAL, and its absence is the existing behaviour exactly: a level with no
 * `child_index_param` keeps a purely local index, so nothing that works today

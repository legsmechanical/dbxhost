/**
 * param_meta.mjs — resolve a param key to its declared metadata, and classify
 * how a knob page should treat it.
 *
 * PURE, like page_plan.mjs: inputs are the parsed `ui_hierarchy` and
 * `chain_params`; nothing here reads or writes a param.
 *
 * Precedence deliberately matches the list editor's `getParamMetadata`
 * (shadow_ui.js): `{ ...inlineHierarchyMeta, ...chainParamsMeta }` — chain_params
 * wins on any field both declare, and the inline entry supplies what
 * chain_params omits (most usefully `label`, which chain_params spells `name`).
 * Matching it matters: the same param must not read differently depending on
 * whether you are looking at the list or the grid.
 *
 * Fleet reality this is built against (76 modules, see
 * docs/plans/2026-07-26-param-pages-audit.md):
 *   chain_params   float 1685, int 1125, enum 774, filepath 22, wav_position 2,
 *                  string 1, canvas 1; ui_type:"wav_position" a further 19
 *   inline params  float 212, enum 118, int 56, filepath 4, toggle 2
 *   inline extras  default 330, min/max 268, step 247, unit 124, options 116,
 *                  display_format 16 — all of which must survive resolution
 *   metadata gaps  only 3 modules declare knob keys with no chain_params entry
 *                  (impressive-chords 15, sfz 8, clap 2), so inference is a
 *                  narrow fallback and never infers structure.

     * cells on knob pages, of which 953 (99%) wear NO mark at all. Divability

     *   corner brackets   7 cells, ALL turnable    "the knob works, AND it opens"
     *   chevron box       7 cells, NONE turnable   "there is no knob; only a door"

/**
 * param_card.mjs — the floating card a MODULE draws while its knob is turned.
 *
 * Some values only mean something as a picture. A crossfade sitting between two
 * named waveform anchors is a position, not a number; a delay feedback that
 * computes to eleven audible repeats and then to HI CUT ONLY is a reading no
 * unit can spell. The grid can draw an envelope, a filter and six other named
 * graphics, but those are a fixed vocabulary — a module whose value falls
 * outside it has had nowhere to put the picture, and has had to ship its own
 * whole-screen editor to get one.
 *
 * So a parameter may name a drawer, and while its knob is held or has just been
 * turned the drawer paints a card over the page:
 *
 *   { "key": "blend", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1, "step": 0.01,
 *     "card_script": "cards.js#blend_card", "card_w": 96, "card_h": 44 }
 *
 * ⭑ IT FLOATS, AND THAT IS WHY IT NEEDS NO CLEAR. The enum peek beside it is
 * full-screen on purpose and therefore cannot draw without the frame owner's
 * clearScreen — see renderOverlays. A card is the opposite: the page must stay
 * visible around it, so it blanks its OWN rect with fillRect and never asks for
 * the frame. That makes it drawable by an embedded consumer that owns no frame
 * at all, and keeps the library's "no file here clears the screen" contract
 * without an exception. Such a consumer passes its own rect (see
 * paramCardRect); needing no clear is not the same as knowing where to draw.
 *
 * ⭑ A DRAWER CANNOT EXPRESS A SCREEN COORDINATE, exactly as a cell widget
 * cannot. The drawer is handed a frameCtx scoped to the inside of the card, so
 * (0,0) is its own top-left, ctx.width/height are the card's, and there is no
 * accessor that reaches absolute space. The reasoning is frame_ctx.mjs's and
 * applies here for the same reason it applies there: the rect is not stable.
 * A card's size is per PARAMETER and the panel clamps it, so coordinates
 * authored against one card are wrong on the next one -- and a floating card
 * that could paint outside its own border would eat the page it is meant to
 * float over. Two module draw hooks, one coordinate contract.
 *
 * THE SPLIT: THE MODULE DECLARES THE SIZE, THIS FILE OWNS THE FRAME.
 * The card is positioned, clamped, cleared and bordered here; the drawer is
 * handed the content rect and paints inside it. A module that positioned itself
 * would eventually leave debris — the size is per parameter, so it changes as
 * the focus moves between knobs, and a shrinking card must not leave the last
 * one's edges behind.
 *
 * Frame grammar is the knob card's, deliberately: 2px border, one black row
 * inside it, a cleared gutter outside. Two cards that differ only in who filled
 * them should not read as two different objects.

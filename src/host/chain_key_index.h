 * Indexed component keys: "fx3:cutoff", "midi_fx2:rate".
 *
 * Header-only and dependency-free on purpose, so tests/host can compile and
 * RUN it natively (tests/host/test_chain_key_index.c) instead of only grepping
 * for it. The routing in chain_host.c is one branch per prefix now, so this
 * parser is the single point where an off-by-one would silently send a
 * parameter to the wrong FX slot.
 *
 * In src/host/ rather than beside chain_host.c because chain_permute.h needs
 * it and chain_permute.h is now shared with the shim — see the location note
 * at the top of that file. Despite the name, nothing here is chain-specific:
 * the prefix and the cap are both parameters.

 * Shared digit scan behind both spellings below: prefix + 1-based index, with
 * *end left at the first character after the digits so each wrapper can say
 * what is allowed to follow. Returns the 0-based index, or -1.
 *
 * Replaces two copy-paste branches that differed only by 0 vs 1 over
 * machinery that was already index-generic. Enumerating eight of them would
 * be eight times the same bug surface.
 *
 * `max` is a PARAMETER on purpose. Reading MAX_AUDIO_FX / MAX_MIDI_FX
 * directly would look like a simplification and would cost two things: this
 * header would stop being includable on its own (it would depend on
 * chain_internal.h, and so on include order), and the test could no longer
 * drive the parser at an arbitrary bound to prove it is cap-agnostic. The
 * caller names the cap because the caller knows which list it is indexing.
 *
 * Leading zeros are rejected ("fx01" is not an id we emit), and the digit
 * loop bails the moment it passes `max` — these strings arrive from patch and
 * preset JSON under /data/UserData, which a user can hand-edit, so an
 * unbounded accumulate would be signed overflow (UB) on input we do not
 * control.

/*
 * bus_mix.h — per-voice bus routing and mixing arithmetic.
 *
 * Header-only and dependency-free for the same reason as master_fx_key.h and
 * chain_key_index.h: so tests/host can compile and RUN it natively. Its caller
 * is chain_host.c's v2_render_block, a translation unit that cannot be built on
 * the dev machine, which is how arithmetic like this ships untested.
 *
 * THE ALIASING IS THE FEATURE. Two voices in one bus are handed the SAME
 * pointer, so their sum happens in the module's own accumulating render with no
 * mixing pass of ours at all, and a voice in no bus is handed the main buffer
 * so the sparse case costs literally nothing. Callers must therefore clear only
 * the DISTINCT buffers (bus_mix_active_mask) and modules must ACCUMULATE.
 *
 * PER-VOICE SENDS ARE A SUPERSET LAID OVER THAT, not a replacement for it: a
 * voice that asks for one is handed its own buffer (bus_mix_solo_mask,
 * bus_mix_build_table_split) and folded back afterwards, and a voice that does
 * not is aliased exactly as above. bus_mix_active_mask is deliberately
 * UNCHANGED by the partition — a solo voice's bus still has to be cleared and
 * still runs its inserts, because that is where the voice's audio ends up.
 *
 * Every function here runs on the SCHED_FIFO SPI callback: no allocation, no
 * I/O, no locks.
 *
 * THE MODULE CONTRACT FOR move_plugin_render_split (a dlsym'd symbol, not a
 * field on plugin_api_v2_t — see chain_host.c's v2_load_synth): a module
 * offering per-voice render is switched between it and render_block AT
 * RUNTIME, PER FRAME, by whether the slot's synth currently has any voice
 * assigned to a bus. Assigning a single voice on the shadow UI flips the
 * module's active entry point mid-stream with no reload, so both must be
 * state-compatible — same voice allocator, same envelope/LFO/phase state.
 * render_split ACCUMULATES into voice_out[] and into main_out (the caller
 * clears destinations first), the opposite of render_block's overwrite, and
 * must never write more than the `frames` argument's worth of samples into any
 * voice_out[] entry or into main_out — those pointers alias the shared bus
 * buffers and the caller's own output. A module must never memset a
 * destination itself, for the same reason: the buffers alias, so clearing one
 * clears another voice's audio.
 *
 * main_out is the trailing-but-one argument
 * (..., int n_voices, int16_t *main_out, int frames) and carries audio
 * belonging to NO voice — a drum bus, a mix compressor, an internal send
 * return. It is the same buffer an unassigned voice is handed, so it is only
 * unreachable through voice_out[] when every voice is on a bus, which is the
 * case it exists for.

 * ================= THE SOLO PARTITION =======================================
 *
 * A per-voice send has to be scaled per voice, and the aliasing above makes
 * that impossible for a voice sharing a bus buffer: by the time the chain sees
 * that buffer the module has already summed them into it. So a voice that
 * actually asks for one — and ONLY such a voice — is handed its own buffer out
 * of a pool, its sends are taken from that, and its audio is then accumulated
 * into the destination it would have had. Everything downstream is unchanged.
 *
 * The rule is therefore exactly: **a voice is solo-buffered iff it has a
 * non-zero per-voice send level.** All-zero is the sparse case and must stay
 * byte-for-byte what it was — aliased, no pool slot cleared, no extra pass —
 * which is what keeps buses cheap and is what test_bus_mix.c pins by running
 * the two build paths against each other.
 *
 * `voice_send` is a FLAT [n_voices][n_sends] table of 0..127 levels; passing
 * NULL means no voice has one.

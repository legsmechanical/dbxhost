/*
 * e16_mirror_shm.h -- what the E16 is showing, for the web mirror.
 *
 * Written by shadow_ui (the E16 surface), read by display_server, which
 * streams it at /stream-e16 beside Move's own screen. It is what we BELIEVE
 * the E16 shows: the screen bytes it has been sent (the display's belief,
 * lastSentBuf) and the last ring sent for each knob. A row the device dropped
 * looks right here until the surface repairs it.
 *
 * Torn-read protection is a sequence counter: the writer makes it ODD before
 * writing and EVEN after; a reader copies only between two equal, even reads.
 * `last_update_ms` (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) is refreshed at least every second while
 * the surface is live, so a reader can tell a stopped writer from a still
 * screen.

/* sampler_wav_trim.h - dropping the preroll off the front of an open WAV.
 *
 * A header, and a static inline, for the same reason sampler_stem_path.h is:
 * the take and each of its five stems go through this, and a second copy of
 * it is how the two halves drift. It is here rather than in shadow_sampler.c
 * so tests/host can run it against a real file on the dev machine — which is
 * the only thing that would have caught what it did for five months.
 *
 * WHAT IT DID: `f` must be open for READING as well as writing ("w+b"). Both
 * callers opened it "wb". The fread below then returned 0 on the very first
 * pass, the copy loop broke immediately — and the ftruncate ran anyway,
 * cutting `preroll_frames` off the END of a file whose front had never moved.
 * The saved take was the PREROLL, at exactly the right duration, so it read as
 * a recording that started early rather than as a trim that never happened.
 * Nothing failed loudly: the caller's "trimmed N preroll frames" log line was
 * printed on the strength of a return value of 1.
 *
 * So the truncate is conditional on the copy now. A short read leaves the file
 * WHOLE and reports it: a take that kept its preroll can be trimmed by hand,
 * one that has been truncated has lost the audio for good.
 *
 * Header is NOT rewritten here — the caller stamps the final size. Returns 1
 * if the audio moved and *frames was updated.
 *
 * Runs on the shim worker (SCHED_OTHER). The malloc, the seeks and the paced
 * writer are the reason this is not on the RT path. */

/*
 * Renumbering a chain section WITHOUT unloading anything.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Adding, removing or reordering a module used to be
 * expressed to the DSP as a sequence of `<id>:module` writes, and every such
 * write unloads the position and dlopen()s a fresh instance. So inserting a
 * MIDI FX at the head destroyed and rebuilt every MIDI FX behind it, and
 * removing a mid-chain audio FX did the same to everything downstream. The
 * editor papered over that by carrying each module's opaque `:state` blob, its
 * modulation base and its LFO routing across the renumber — but a state blob is
 * not an instance. A running arpeggiator loses its phase; a reverb or delay
 * loses the tail that was ringing. Reported on hardware as "we can't change
 * phase of a running module by just adding a new one".
 *
 * Renumbering is an ARRAY PERMUTATION, not a teardown. The instance keeps
 * running; only its index changes. This header is that permutation, kept pure
 * and dependency-free (like chain_key_index.h beside it) so it can be compiled
 * and RUN natively by tests/host rather than only verified by ear on hardware.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN src/host/. It was written for the chain DSP and sat in
 * src/modules/chain/dsp/. Master FX is a permuted list too, and it lives in the
 * SHIM (shadow_chain_mgmt.c) — which has no include path into a dlopen'd
 * module's private directory, and must not grow one. The alternative was a
 * second copy, and a copy of a cap or a shift is exactly the bug class that
 * made fx3..fx8 silent. So the header moved to the place both units already
 * reach (the chain includes host/plugin_api_v1.h from here), and it stays pure:
 * nothing in it knows what a chain is.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE. A chain position is described by a dozen parallel arrays
 * — the dlopen handle, the vtable, the instance pointer, the module name, the
 * param metadata, the bypass flag, and so on. Anything a permutation MISSES
 * becomes a module driving another module's parameters, which is far worse than
 * the bug being fixed. So this takes the arrays as DATA (a list of base/stride
 * pairs) rather than naming any of them, the caller enumerates them once, and
 * a test pins that enumeration against the struct definition.

/*
 * One per-position array: `base` is element 0, `elem` the stride.
 *
 * `pointee` is what separates the two KINDS of per-position array, and getting
 * it wrong is a null dereference on the audio thread rather than a wrong value:
 *
 *   0        a VALUE array — the position owns its bytes. Vacating one means
 *            zeroing them.
 *   non-zero an OWNED-BUFFER array — the position holds a pointer to a block
 *            allocated once per position by chain_alloc_position_storage and
 *            never null (the param metadata and the cached ui_hierarchy). The
 *            value here is that block's size.
 *
 * An owned-buffer array must be ROTATED, never zeroed. Zeroing the pointer for
 * a vacated position breaks the never-null invariant every reader depends on —
 * `inst->fx_ui_hierarchy[i][0]` is read without a check in a dozen places, and
 * v2_load_midi_fx_slot parses a module's param table straight into
 * `inst->midi_fx_params[slot]`. It also LEAKS: the shift overwrites the pointer
 * that was already at the destination, and nothing else holds it. Both were
 * live for one commit and the second one reached hardware as a SIGSEGV at
 * si_addr=0 in the SPI callback, loading a MIDI FX in front of an existing one.
 *
 * So the vacated position receives the buffer displaced off the end of the
 * shift, and it is the buffer's CONTENTS that are cleared rather than the
 * pointer. Nothing is allocated, nothing is freed, nothing becomes null, and
 * the multiset of pointers is identical before and after — which is exactly
 * what the tests assert.

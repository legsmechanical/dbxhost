 * THE IN RING IS SIZED FOR MOVE'S JITTER, NOT FOR SYMMETRY WITH THE PUB RING.
 *
 * It used to be `LINK_AUDIO_PUB_SHM_BLOCKS` (16 blocks = 4096 stereo samples =
 * 46 ms), inherited from the publish side because the two sit next to each
 * other in this header. The two directions do not have the same problem. We
 * write the pub ring on a metronome - one block per SPI frame. Move writes
 * this one in bursts.
 *
 * Measured upstream on hardware 2026-08-27 with the sidecar's own delivery
 * telemetry (`cb slot=N max_gap=... max_burst_run=...`), under a load that
 * made it misbehave - a synth in a slot, drum kit on the Move track:
 *
 *     max_gap        = 92 ms      Move publishes nothing at all
 *     max_burst_run  = 30 blocks  then 30 callbacks back to back (~85 ms)
 *     avail max      = 13128 stereo samples = 149 ms
 *
 * All four channels stalled within 5 ms of each other, so it is one shared
 * stall in Move's publisher rather than per-channel jitter.
 *
 * A 46 ms ring cannot absorb a 92 ms stall - it is empty less than halfway
 * through - and it cannot hold the 85 ms burst that follows, so the producer
 * laps the consumer (`would_overrun` was ~51 per 5 s window). The result was
 * ~16% of frames with no Move audio at all.
 *
 * 64 blocks = 16384 stereo samples = 8192 frames = 186 ms, which is ~2x the
 * worst observed stall and ~1.25x the worst observed `avail`. Cost is 4 slots
 * x 32 KB = 128 KB of SHM, up from 32 KB.
 *
 * This does NOT add steady-state latency. The consumer sets the pace: it takes
 * one block per SPI frame whatever the ring holds, so mean `avail` stays where
 * Move's delivery puts it (~16 ms measured). A deeper ring only changes what
 * happens during a burst - absorbed instead of discarded.
 *
 * MUST stay a power of two: LINK_AUDIO_IN_RING_MASK is used as `& mask` by
 * both the sidecar's writer and the shim's reader.

/*
 * SPSC discipline for /schwung-midi-out (shadow_midi_out_t).
 *
 * THE CONSUMER USED TO WRITE THE PRODUCER'S REGION, and that is the bug this
 * file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * shadow_inject_ui_midi_out() (the shim, SPI callback) did:
 *
 *     int snapshot_len = midi_out_shm->write_idx;
 *     memcpy(local_buf, midi_out_shm->buffer, copy_len);
 *     __sync_synchronize();
 *     midi_out_shm->write_idx = 0;
 *     memset(midi_out_shm->buffer, 0, SHADOW_MIDI_OUT_BUFFER_SIZE);
 *
 * while js_shadow_midi_send() (shadow_ui, a SEPARATE PROCESS) appended at
 * write_idx and returned JS_TRUE. A packet written between the `snapshot_len`
 * read and the memset is erased, and its index discarded with `write_idx = 0`
 * — after the sender has already been told it was sent.
 *
 * That loss is invisible to every counter on either side: JS counts it as
 * sent, the shim never sees it. One lost packet inside a SysEx run corrupts
 * the whole message, which the E16 renders as a garbled screen. The shim
 * drains ~344x/sec and JS writes bursts of up to 34 packets at ~60 Hz, so the
 * window is small and hit regularly under load — which is why the fault
 * presented as "garbles when playing and turning knobs fast" and survived
 * every pacing change.
 *
 * The old code's own comment ("Copy before resetting to avoid a race where the
 * JS process writes new data between our reset and memcpy") shows the race was
 * considered. Reordering the copy and the reset only closes the half where the
 * reset comes first; the memset reopens it.
 *
 * The rule here, and there is no exception to it:
 *
 *   - the PRODUCER (shadow_ui) owns `write_idx` and the bytes at and after it.
 *     It never reads or writes `read_idx`.
 *   - the CONSUMER (the shim) owns `read_idx`. It never writes `write_idx` and
 *     NEVER writes the buffer — no memset, not even of bytes it has consumed.
 *
 * Each side reading a stale copy of the other's index is safe by construction:
 * a stale (smaller) read_idx makes the producer conservative about free space,
 * and a stale (smaller) write_idx makes the consumer take less this frame. A
 * torn read cannot happen — both are naturally aligned uint16 on ARM64.
 *
 * INDICES ARE FREE-RUNNING BYTE COUNTS, not offsets. They wrap at 2^16, and
 * that is exact rather than approximate: 65536 is a whole multiple of
 * SHADOW_MIDI_OUT_BUFFER_SIZE, so (uint16)(write_idx - read_idx) is the true
 * distance across the wrap. The buffer position is `idx & (SIZE - 1)`.
 *
 * Capacity is one packet short of the buffer, because a full ring and an empty
 * one are both `write_idx == read_idx` and there is no third index to tell
 * them apart. Spending 4 bytes is cheaper than a flag that has to be written
 * by whichever side moved last.

/* The masking above is only a masking if the size is a power of two, and the
 * wrap arithmetic is only exact if 2^16 divides it. Both hold at 512 (this
 * fork; upstream grew to 4096 for the E16) and at 4096; neither
 * is obvious from the constant, and a "round" resize to, say, 3000 would break
 * the distance calculation silently — the ring would appear to work and lose a
 * message per wrap. */

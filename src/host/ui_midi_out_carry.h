/*
 * The shadow_ui -> MIDI_OUT carry: what could not be placed this frame.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * shadow_inject_ui_midi_out() used to snapshot the shadow_ui SHM buffer, reset
 * write_idx, MEMSET THE SOURCE, and only then start placing packets into the
 * 80-byte MIDI_OUT region — stopping at the first frame boundary it could not
 * fit. Everything past that point in the snapshot was gone: not delayed, not
 * retried, not counted, not logged. The comment on ext_midi_ring_drain named
 * it in passing ("The loss downstream is shadow_inject_ui_midi_out's, which
 * memsets its source before copying") and nothing acted on it.
 *
 * MIDI_OUT holds 20 packets, and the drain ran once per shadow_ui flush rather
 * than once per SPI frame, so the real ceiling was ~20 packets per 60 Hz tick
 * = 3600 SysEx data bytes/s. DIN MIDI is 3125 bytes/s. The whole outbound
 * budget sat 15% above the wire rate with no backpressure and no margin, which
 * is why short control messages "work more or less perfectly" while any bulk
 * dump loses whole packets from the middle — the same multiple-of-3 signature
 * as #358, from the opposite direction.
 *
 * A 158-byte SysEx message is 53 packets. It cannot fit in one frame and never
 * could; the bug was never the frame size, it was that the remainder had
 * nowhere to live.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 *
 * It gives the remainder somewhere to live. Packets that do not fit stay here,
 * in order, and go out on the next SPI frame — a DELAY instead of a loss, the
 * same contract ext_midi_ring_drain already honours for the DSP path (it does
 * not advance `tail` when the region fills). That alone lifts the ceiling from
 * ~20 packets per 60 Hz tick to ~20 per 344 Hz frame: 6x clear of DIN rate
 * instead of 15% above it.
 *
 * It is header-only and pure — no allocation, no I/O, no locks, no globals —
 * for the same reason as fx_midi_filter.h and ext_midi_ring.h: the only caller
 * is the SPI callback, which cannot be built on the dev machine, and filtering
 * like this is exactly what ends up shipped untested. tests/host compiles and
 * RUNS it natively.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT
 *
 * A SysEx message is a run of packets that only means anything in sequence.
 * Appends go to the tail, drains take from the head, and a partial drain
 * shifts the remainder down rather than leaving a hole. Reordering a SysEx run
 * is worse than dropping it: the receiver assembles a well-framed message out
 * of shuffled data and has no way to know.

 * The mailbox holds 20 and the carry used to fill every free slot, so a long
 * SysEx went out at ~6900 packets/s. Measured on an OXI E16 over USB-A
 * 2026-09-10: a 394-packet framebuffer arrived with most of its middle
 * missing -- a full-width bar drawn at the bottom rendered as a fragment
 * partway up the screen, because every lost packet shifts what follows
 * earlier. Handing the same frame over at 6 packets per frame put the bar
 * exactly where it was drawn.
 *
 * The loss is RATE dependent, not size dependent, which is the same shape as
 * the inbound losses in #358: docs/SYSEX.md measures 31 packets sent alone
 * arriving byte-perfect and 34 amid other traffic losing 8. So the fix belongs
 * HERE, in the transport, not in any one producer -- every module sending a
 * bulk dump hits the same wall, and a rate chosen per-caller would be a rate
 * nobody else benefits from.
 *
 * 3 x 344 Hz is ~1000 packets/s, still a third above DIN rate, and it costs
 * nothing that is felt: a repaint follows a deliberate action, and the common
 * case -- a knob turn -- is a single 7-byte message that goes out in one frame
 * either way.

 * a Move packet ends up INSIDE one of ours:
 *
 *   ACROSS frames -- a message straddles an SPI frame, and Move's note in the
 *   next frame goes on the wire between its halves. The pace made every long
 *   message straddle.
 *   WITHIN a frame -- placement took the first free slots ANYWHERE, so with a
 *   Move note in slot 4 ours could fill 0-3 and 5+: the note in the middle.
 *
 * The strongest measurement in the whole E16 investigation (2026-09-11): a
 * message placed entirely in ONE frame arrived intact 78/78 under a flood of
 * notes, clock and aftertouch. So a message that FITS is placed WHOLE, in one
 * frame, only in free slots AFTER the last of Move's cable-2 packets in that
 * frame -- or not at all this frame. A Move packet can then only sit before
 * or after one of ours on the wire, never inside it. Cable-0 packets (Move's

 * they may sit between ours freely.
 *
 * "Fits" is a complete run of at most UI_MIDI_CARRY_ATOMIC_MAX packets: the

 * whole message goes per frame even when it is larger than the pace -- the
 * pace protects Move's share of the mailbox, and a 10-packet message in a
 * frame is inside the 12 it already allows. Longer messages (a framebuffer,
 * LABELS, another tool's bulk dump) and malformed runs take the paced,

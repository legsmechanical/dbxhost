/*
 * audio_live_shm.h -- the audio that goes with the web mirror's picture.
 *
 * The shim writes one block (128 stereo frames) per SPI frame into a ring;
 * display-server reads what is new every pass and streams it to /mirror
 * clients that asked for sound (`/stream-auto?v=2&audio=1`), where it is
 * played and recorded alongside the drawn device.
 *
 * WHAT is written is the CAPTURE view, the same audio Skipback and the
 * sampler record: the full mix at unity, independent of the volume knob, after
 * the master filter. When nothing of Schwung's is running the shim takes a
 * fast path that never builds that view; there the mailbox (Move's own mix,
 * already scaled by master volume) is un-scaled by 1/mv the same way, so the
 * level does not jump when a slot loads.
 *
 * Single producer (the SPI callback), any number of readers. The writer
 * stores samples first and publishes `write_pos` (total frames ever written)
 * with release; a reader loads it with acquire and copies at most the newest
 * AUDIO_LIVE_FRAMES / 2, so the writer -- one block per 2.9 ms -- cannot lap
 * the span being copied. Realtime: a copy of 512 bytes, no syscalls.

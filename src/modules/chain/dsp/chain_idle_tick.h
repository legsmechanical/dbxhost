/* The idle-tick handshake between the shim's idle gate and the chain host.
 *
 * Kept out of chain_host.c so the transitions are unit-testable host-side
 * without the full chain host. No side effects, no allocation — this runs on
 * the SPI callback.
 *
 * The shim skips render_block on a silent slot (one probe frame in
 * SLOT_PROBE_WINDOW_FRAMES, see schwung_shim.c) and calls "mod:tick" instead,
 * so LFO and MIDI FX timers keep advancing. If a MIDI FX emits a message to
 * the synth on such a frame, that same block must render — otherwise the note
 * reaches a slot that will not be heard until the next probe, up to half a
 * second later. Three facts have to survive between the two calls the shim
 * makes:
 *
 *   mark()    mod:tick advanced both timers this frame, and whether a MIDI FX
 *             delivered anything to the synth.
 *   take()    the shim asks, once, whether to un-park the slot. A one-shot: if
 *             the answer is no there will be no render, so the double-tick
 *             guard is cleared here rather than left standing for whichever
 *             frame renders next.
 *   consume() render_block asks whether it still owes a tick. After a wake the
 *             answer is no — mod:tick already did it, and ticking twice is a
 *             doubled LFO rate and a doubled arp.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE INTERESTING FAILURE IS A LEAK, NOT A CRASH. An `advanced` guard left
 * standing after a frame that does not render makes the NEXT render silently
 * skip one LFO and MIDI FX tick — forever, with nothing to attribute it to.
 * take() is what makes the pair self-clearing, so a shim that never calls it
 * (a host with no dlsym for the export) costs at most one skipped tick on the
 * next render rather than latching the guard for the life of the instance.

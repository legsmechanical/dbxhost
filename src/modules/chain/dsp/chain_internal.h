/* ⚠⚠ FORK DIVERGENCE — A BUS CHAIN HAS ITS OWN CAP, AND IT IS NOT MAX_AUDIO_FX.
 *
 * Upstream sizes a bus's insert chain with MAX_AUDIO_FX, which is 8 there and 4
 * here. Josh ruled a module may ship a bus of up to 8 effects ("give them more
 * room") — a fork truncating at 4 would silently drop what a module declared.
 *
 * Raising MAX_AUDIO_FX 4 -> 8 to get that would ALSO widen every SLOT chain,
 * and 60 sites across 8 files (davebox included) spell out `fx4` by hand, plus
 * 14 static arrays x 8 slots of memory. That is exactly the trap CLAUDE.md
 * warns about ("any change to FX-block handling must be checked at fx3/fx4
 * too"). Buses do not exist here yet, so the NEW chains get their own cap and
 * none of those 60 sites move.
 *
 * So: BUS_FX_SLOTS sizes anything belonging to a BUS; MAX_AUDIO_FX keeps
 * sizing the slot's own chain. Do not collapse them back into one name without
 * deciding the separate, undecided question of whether a slot chain goes to 8.
 * src/shared/bus_model.mjs carries the JS copy as BUS_FX_SLOTS and

 *
 * Raising this is a one-line change HERE and a matching one in
 * src/shared/bus_model.mjs; test_bus_model.sh fails on drift between the two.
 * All "bus<N>:" key routing goes through bus_route.h with this passed in as
 * bus_count, and every loop over buses is bounded by this name. Read out of
 * this line by tests/host/test_bus_route.sh and by tests/host/Makefile. The
 * bitmask in bus_mix_active_mask is a uint32_t, so 32 is the hard ceiling.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS NOT FREE, and the cost is not the audio buffers (512 bytes each, on
 * demand). It is bus_config_t, embedded SLOT_BUSES times in patch_info_t, which
 * is embedded MAX_PATCHES times in chain_instance_t — see the MAX_PATCHES
 * warning above, which this compounds.
 *
 * MEASURED for this fork, aarch64, -O3, via sizes emitted as linker symbols by
 * the cross-compiler (so these are the TARGET ABI's numbers, not the host's):
 *
 *     bus_config_t          9,844 B
 *     patch_info_t        168,504 -> 247,264 B   (+76.9 KB)
 *     chain_instance_t     12.85  ->  15.36 MB   (+2.50 MB, x4 slots = +10.0 MB)
 *
 * ⭑ IT COSTS NO STACK AT ALL HERE, and that is a real difference from upstream
 * rather than luck. Upstream's copy of this warning says the SPI callback's
 * frame grows with it, because THERE v2_set_param's load_file route holds a
 * patch_info_t local. THIS FORK ALREADY MOVED THAT TO THE HEAP, deliberately —
 * see the "Heap, not stack" comment at chain_host.c's load_file route. Verified
 * with -fstack-usage across every chain TU: no frame moved by a single byte
 * between the pre-bus tree and this one, and chain_bus.c's own largest frame is
 * 832 B.
 *
 * So re-measure the HEAP before raising this again; the stack is not the
 * constraint in this tree. (⚠ Unrelated and pre-existing: the largest frame in

 * Is a plugin's chain_params answer worth serving, or should the module.json
 * fallback beneath it run?
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES IS SILENT AND USER-VISIBLE. A module that reads its
 * chain_params from a JSON file at runtime answers the two characters "[]"
 * when that file is not installed — which it is not, in a shipped tarball.
 * Length 2 is > 0, so the host took it as an answer, discarded the parameter
 * declarations it had ALREADY parsed out of that module's own module.json, and
 * served "[]". The Shadow UI then had no type for any of those params and drove
 * every one as a float 0..1: an int wrote a fraction its atoi read as 0, an
 * enum took option 0. It presents as "i could see the values change, but when i
 * release, it reset to the default" — which sounds like an edit/commit bug and
 * is actually a metadata bug two layers away.
 *
 * An empty array is therefore treated as NO answer, and the fallback runs. A
 * plugin that genuinely has no parameters loses nothing: the fallback finds no
 * parsed params either and the caller returns -1, which the UI reads exactly as
 * it read "[]".
 *
 * Pure scan over a caller-owned buffer — no allocation, no I/O — because every
 * one of those routes is serviced from the SPI callback.

/*
 * chain_bus.c — the "bus<N>:" parameter surface, the voice map, the patch
 * apply, and the worker's reconcile step.
 *
 * A sibling of chain_host.c rather than more of it, for the same reason
 * chain_patch.c and chain_reorder.c are.
 *
 * ================= WHICH THREAD OWNS WHAT ==================================
 *
 * TWO THREADS touch slot_bus_t and the split is the whole design:
 *
 *   RT (the SPI callback: set_param, get_param, render_block, and everything
 *   chain_patch.c calls) owns the REQUEST — fx_request[], fx_state_request[],
 *   fx_bypassed[], voice_ids[], send_level[], in_use, name. It never allocates,
 *   never opens a file and never dlopens.
 *
 *   The WORKER (chain_bus_worker_fn, SCHED_OTHER on cores 0-2) owns the
 *   REALISATION — buf, fx_handles[], fx_plugins_v2[], fx_instances[],
 *   fx_params[], fx_ui_hierarchy[], fx_count, current_fx_modules[]. Every
 *   dlopen, create_instance and multi-megabyte calloc in this feature happens
 *   there and nowhere else.
 *
 * Because get_param answers from the REQUEST side, the UI never has to read a
 * field the worker is writing, and the "what is loaded" answer is positional
 * and immediate rather than lagging a load.
 *
 * The two are joined by exactly two gates: `buf` (RELEASE/ACQUIRE, published by
 * the worker) and `fx_ready` (likewise, covering everything in the second list
 * above). See slot_bus_t's own comments — the second gate exists because the
 * first orders `buf` and nothing else.
 *
 * THE SECOND GATE IS A SEQUENCE NUMBER, NOT A FLAG, and every read of it goes
 * through bus_fx_ready(). The RT side closes it by bumping fx_req_seq alone;
 * the worker opens it by publishing the seq it started its pass from. That is
 * one atomic on each side, so there is no window in which the worker can
 * observe the gate as "still mine to open" and then open it after the RT thread
 * has closed it. The earlier boolean form had exactly that window — the worker
 * compared fx_req_seq, was preempted, and stored a bare 1 over a clear the RT
 * thread had made in between, which put process_block() on the audio thread in
 * a race with the destroy_instance() and dlclose() of the very next reconcile.

     * PER-VOICE SENDS, into the SAME accumulators the buses just fed.
     *
     * Taken here rather than inside v2_render_block for one reason that is not
     * a preference: `accum` does not exist there. The shim owns the global send
     * buses and hands them to this call, after the render, together with the
     * slot's gain — so this is the only point at which a per-voice send can be
     * both taken from the voice's own audio AND scaled by the fader.
     *
     * POST-FADER like the per-bus send above, and for the same reason: mute and
     * solo arrive as gain 0, and a muted slot still feeding the reverb is a bug
     * nobody could find from the mixer. PRE-INSERT is the half that differs —
     * voice_send_buf[i] is what the MODULE rendered, before the bus's chain ran
     * on the sum.
     *
     * The mask is THIS frame's (v2_render_block clears it on every path,
     * bypass included), so a voice whose level was just zeroed stops sending
     * immediately rather than draining a stale pool slot forever.
